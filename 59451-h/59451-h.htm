<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>

<p>The publication in the <cite>British Journal of
Photography</cite> of Mr. Taylor’s Paper, with the
proceedings of the meeting at which it was
read, has aroused a wide-spread and deep interest
in the subject. The principal portions of
it, and, in some instances the whole of the
Paper, together with editorial comments, have
subsequently appeared in newspapers and
journals in Canada, Australia, India, America,
and other countries. As his experiments will
be a matter of historical interest, many scientific
men will be pleased to have his Paper in this
book form, with the reproductions of two of the
psychic pictures which he obtained on his photographic
plates.</p>

<p>The term “spirit photographs” is generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
used to describe photographs of psychic entities
who cannot be seen by ordinary persons,
but can be photographed by a medium, or
with the help of a medium, and with the
co-operation of these unseen entities. Such
portraits are obtained both indoors and in
the open air, with and without a background,
by natural light and by artificial light; and,
in the case of “materialised” forms at séances,
which are visible to every person present, the
portraits have sometimes been taken by light
produced by the spirits, the exact nature of
which is unknown.</p>

<p>The following may serve as a rough
classification of what are called spirit photographs:—</p>

<p>1. Portraits of psychical entities not seen
by normal vision.</p>

<p>2. Pictures of objects not seen nor thought
of by the sitter or by the medium or operator;
such as flowers, words, crosses, crowns, lights,
and various emblematic objects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span></p>

<p>3. Pictures which have the appearance of
being copied from statues, paintings, or drawings.
Sometimes these are busts or heads
only. The flatness in some photographs of
this class is supposed, by persons who have
<em>not</em> investigated the subject, to be proof that
the photographs are produced in a fraudulent
manner.</p>

<p>4. Pictures of what are called materialised
forms visible to normal sight.</p>

<p>5. Pictures of the “wraith” or “double”
of persons still in the body.</p>

<p>6. Portraits on plates which developers have
failed to bring into view, but that can be seen
and described by clairvoyants and by mediums
when in trance and whose descriptions agree,
though made independently.</p>

<p>There are, also, portraits that cannot be
classed as photographs, as they have not
been taken by the agency of a camera, or
by exposing the prepared plate previous to
development of the image.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span></p>

contained in this volume on the subject of spirit
photography should read the following:—</p>

<p>“All great discoveries have at first been derided as ridiculous
and then denounced as impious, and lastly adopted as a matter
of course. Let us, then, as we have to learn to labour and to
wait, stand firm for the expansion of human faculty, increase of

<h3><i><span class="smcap">What led to the recent Experiments
in Psychic Photography.</span></i></h3>

<p>A number of test séances for spirit
photography had been held with Mr.
David Duguid, of which no records have been
kept, but in April and May, 1892, four séances
were held under strict test conditions, notes of
which were made at the time, and signed by
the various persons who were present. These
notes were printed for private circulation, and
a copy was sent, with some of the photographs,
to Mr. Frederic W. H. Myers, Cambridge,
(Hon. Secretary Psychical Research Society).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>He suggested that when there was another
opportunity for a test séance, the presence of
a “scientific man,” and some one well acquainted
with photographic manipulations, be
got to attend to watch the experiments.</p>

<p>One of the investigators induced Mr.
Duguid to come to London to give a séance
under the strictest test conditions which could
be devised; and Mr. J. Traill Taylor, Editor
of the <cite>British Journal of Photography</cite>, by
special request consented to take charge of the
experiments, and to fix the conditions under
which they should be made.</p>

<p>Mr. Taylor combines in himself the special
qualities named by Mr. Myers, inasmuch as he
is a “scientific man,” and an expert in photographic
chemistry, optical research, and all
photographic manipulations.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Taylor is the author of several works
relating to the chemistry, optics, physics, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
practice of photography; and besides being a
member of Council of the Photographic Society
of Great Britain, is an honorary member of
the Imperial Polytechnic Society of Russia,
and of all the leading Photographic Clubs
and Societies in London, and of several in
New York.</p>

<h3><i><span class="smcap">Testimony Relating to David Duguid.</span></i></h3>

<p>In a book recently published, entitled <cite>The
Rise and Progress of Modern Spiritualism</cite><a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
(consisting of a reprint of a course of lectures
delivered in Glasgow by Mr. James Robertson),
the author gives the following testimony
as to Mr. Duguid:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For many years we have had resident amongst
us one whose name is world-wide, <em>and whose
character is above reproach</em>; go where you will,
David Duguid is recognised as one of the world’s
mediums. From his lips have come forth volumes
full of wonderful information which he, the normal
man, never gathered of himself, but which is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
product of intelligences who have ripened in that
other sphere of existence. The story of the early
life of Jesus, which is to be found in <cite>Hafed</cite>, the
glimpses of ancient peoples, their manners and
customs, are a valuable contribution to our knowledge.
But he has been famous as a medium for
every phase of the subject, including those marvellous
direct paintings which have done much missionary
work, the direct voices, materialisation, perfumes,
writings in language utterly unknown to him, <em>and
specially in the conclusive evidence he has been the
means of furnishing as to the reality of spirit photography</em>.
The striking story contributed to <cite>Light</cite> by
‘Edina,’ of how a picture of the dead boy was got
after patient waiting, is amongst the best-attested
phenomena. The early and close friend of D. D.
Home, he has revealed almost similar mediumistic
gifts. One of the most genial and retiring of men,
he has ever reverenced his gifts, and sought in his
own modest way to give all and sundry the benefit
of their light.”</p>

</div>

<p>One of Mr. Glendinning’s private letters
to the editor of a photographic journal, with
reference to an intended action for libel, contained
the following:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If my counsel wishes it, I shall produce such
an array of testimonials from men of position as to
Mr. Duguid’s honesty and uprightness as have
seldom been read in any court.”</p>

</div>

<p>That would be an easy thing to do; but,
when it is considered that Mr. Duguid has for
a long time been employed by Mr. Robertson
in his bicycle works; that Mr. Robertson, who
is an active business man and a good judge
of character, is year after year in almost hourly
contact with Mr. Duguid; that he has been
at many of Mr. Duguid’s séances, some of
these being held in his (Mr. Robertson’s) own
house—when these things are borne in mind,
the value of the voluntary tribute given by
Mr. Robertson to Mr. Duguid’s honesty and
uprightness will be the more fully appreciated.</p>

<p>For nearly thirty years has Mr. David
Duguid been before the world as a private
medium for various descriptions of spirit phenomena.
He has given innumerable séances
readily, without fee or desire for reward, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
clergymen, medical men, artists, teachers of
science, lawyers, journalists, merchants, and
men and women in all ranks of life; he has
sacrificed time and money in the cause which
is dear to his heart, and upon which no act or
word of his has ever brought a stain. These
facts are well known to many, nor would it
be necessary to print them here were it not
for the efforts made to destroy public confidence
in the facts brought to light through
his mediumship by writers in certain photographic
journals, and the artful insinuations of
men who put themselves forward on the plea
of being anxious investigators.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap"><i>Where Mr. Taylor read his Paper.</i></span></h3>

<p>At a meeting of the London and Provincial
Photographic Association, held on
March 9, 1893, Mr. J. Weir Brown in the
chair, the following paper by Mr. Taylor was
read by him, and, with his consent, is reprinted
from the <cite>British Journal of Photography</cite> (Vol.
XL., No. 1715, March 17, 1893).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a large attendance of members,
and several visitors were present. Visitors
were allowed to make remarks, a privilege
of which several availed themselves. Some
members put questions to Mr. Taylor on
points of detail regarding his experiments,
all of which he replied to frankly and
explicitly. In replying to one member, Mr.
Taylor stated that he had received a letter,
asking him to bring a reasonable man with
him <em>to witness</em> his experiments—in fact, he
said, he had the option of taking any one
he chose. To another member Mr. Taylor
replied that he himself placed the sitters
and the camera, and also arranged the
lighting of the room. Several members spoke
highly of Mr. Taylor’s qualifications to
conduct such experiments; but as they could
not accept the spiritualistic hypothesis, and as
the photographs had to them the appearance
of being copied from cut-out prints, or made
by “stump-work,” they concluded that therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
they could not be genuine, ignoring entirely Mr.
Taylor’s emphatic statements, which he had
already given in his paper, viz.:—</p>

<p>“<em>My conditions were entirely acquiesced
in</em>”—that I “<em>should use my own camera and
unopened packages of dry plates, purchased
from dealers of repute, and that I should be
excused from allowing a plate to go out of my
own hand till after development</em>,” and that “<em>I
should dictate all the conditions of operation</em>.”</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, everything connected
with the experiments was subject to Mr.
Taylor’s entire control and approval.</p>

<h2 id="FLUORESCENCE">“SPIRIT PHOTOGRAPHY,”
WITH REMARKS ON
FLUORESCENCE.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></h2>

<p class="author"><i>By</i> <span class="smcap">J. Traill Taylor</span>.</p>

<p>The presence of smoke may be considered
as implying the existence of flame. Spirit
photography, so called, has of late been asserting
its existence in such a manner and to such
an extent as to warrant competent men making
an investigation, conducted under stringent
test conditions, into the circumstances under
which such photographs are produced, and
exposing the fraud, should it prove to be
such, instead of pooh-poohing it as insensate
because we do not understand how it can be
otherwise—a position that scarcely commends
itself as intelligent or philosophical. If in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
what follows I call it “spirit photography”
instead of psychic photography, it is only in
deference to a nomenclature that extensively
prevails, and not as offering a surmise from
any knowledge of my own as to what is matter
and what spirit, or the distinction between
mind, spirit, and matter, for in truth I don’t
know. I approach the subject merely as a
photographer.</p>

<p>Before I proceed, a few words on the origin
of spirit photography may not be out of place.
In March, 1861, W. H. Mumler, the principal
engraver in the employ of Bigelow Bros. &amp;
Kennard, the leading jewellers of Boston,
when whiling away an idle hour as an
amateur photographer, had a form other than
that of any one present developed on his
collodion plate. He surmised that it arose
from an image having been previously on the
plate, and its having been imperfectly cleaned
off. Subjected to a more thorough cleaning,
the form again appeared more strongly marked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
than before, and he could offer no other explanation
than the one given. It got noised
abroad through the press that a spirit had
been photographed, and although Mumler
strove to suppress the misrepresentation, as
he regarded it, yet he eventually succumbed
to popular demand, and took two hours a day
from his regular work, devoting them to photography.
This he had to extend to the whole
of each day, entirely discarding his regular
profession. Many men of eminence sat to him,
most of whom he did not know at the time.
He seems to have encouraged his sitters in
the adoption of such test conditions as they
deemed satisfactory. The figures that usually
appeared on the plate with the sitters were,
if I rightly infer, those on whom the sitters’
minds had been set. That eminent portrait
photographer, Mr. Wm. Black, of Boston, so
well known all over the world as the inventor
of the acid nitrate bath, undertook to investigate
the <i lang="la">bonâ fides</i> of Mumler’s methods.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Through a friend who had just previously
sat and obtained a figure, Black offered fifty
dollars if Mumler would operate in his presence
and obtain a picture. Invited to come, the
acute Black critically examined camera, plate,
dipper, and bath, and had his eye on the plate
from the moment its preparation began until
it was sensitised and locked in the dark slide,
removing it himself from the camera, and carrying
it into the dark room, where, on development,
a figure of a man was seen leaning on
B.’s shoulder. Black was wonder-stricken, and
got away the negative, no charge whatever
having been made. Mumler now claimed
publicly to be a spirit-portrait photographer,
and as such he eventually opened a studio in
New York, having previously satisfied Silver,
Gurney, and other photographers as to the
genuineness of his claims, never hesitating to
operate in their galleries if required, and with
their apparatus and chemicals. Mumler was
arrested in New York; whether on the ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
of witchcraft or of endeavouring to obtain
money under false pretences, I am at present
uncertain, but his trial was the sensation of the
day, and numerous witnesses were examined.
He was honourably acquitted.</p>

<p>In this country, several who are amateur
photographers have investigated this subject
with more or less success. These include
some F.R.S.’s, scientists, artists, and others.
I question whether any have so persistently
done so as the late Mr. John Beattie, of Clifton,
and his friend, Dr. Thompson. Mr. Beattie
was a skilled professional photographer of
the highest eminence who, some time prior
to his death, had adopted the views of the
spiritualistic school. The figures he obtained
on his plates were much blurred in outline,
some being misty in the extreme. I possess
some two or three dozen of these, taken by
or in the presence of, Mr. Beattie, whose intelligence,
honesty, and powers of observation
no one would venture to doubt. Many such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
photographs are claimed to have been produced
by Hudson, a professional photographer, formerly
of the Holloway Road, and I submit for examination
a work by the late Miss Houghton,
containing fifty-four of Hudson’s spirit photographs.</p>

<p>There are many ways by which, assuming
the genuineness of only one of all spirit photographs
hitherto produced, the spurious article
may be made even better than any alleged
real ones I have yet seen. A plate secretly
impressed previous or subsequent to being
placed in the camera fulfils the condition; so
does one at the back of which is placed a
phosphorescent tablet in the dark slide. Pressure
on the surface, such as by that of a
Woodbury relief film, also causes a developable
image; in short, trickery in a whole variety of
forms may, and has been, impressed into the
service.</p>

<p>The higher department of fluorescence may
with success be employed. Here is something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
to which believers in the visibility of spirit
forms to a camera are quite welcome. At the
time, and <i lang="la">àpropos</i> of the Mumler trial in New
York, I wrote that a good many absurd things
have been said <i lang="la">pro</i> and <i lang="la">con</i> on the subject; but
a writer in the latter category, who asserted
that anything that is visible to the eye of the
camera, and thus capable of being depicted
by photography, must therefore necessarily be
visible to the human eye, was surely ignorant
of that important branch of physics popularly
known as fluorescence. Many things are
capable of being photographed which to the
physical eye are utterly invisible. Why, for
that matter, a room (visually dark) may be
full of the ultra-violet rays of the spectrum,
and a photograph may be taken in that dark
light. Objects in a room so lighted would
be plainly visible to the lens of the camera—at
any rate, they could be reproduced on the
sensitive plate, while, at the same time, not an
atom of luminousness could be perceived in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the room by any person possessing ordinary
or normal vision. Hence the photographing
of an invisible image, whether it be of a spirit
or a lump of matter is not scientifically
impossible. If it reflect only the ultra-violet
rays of the spectrum, it will be easily photographed,
although quite invisible to the sharpest
eye.</p>

<p>Again, Cromwell F. Varley, F.R.S., well
known as one of the most eminent of electricians,
says (<cite>Electric</cite>, June, 1871), when passing a
current of electricity through a vacuum tube,
the results of which were indicated by touches
of light about the poles:—“In one instance,
although the experiment was carried on in a
dark room, this light was so feeble that it
could not be seen, and the operators doubted
if the current were passing. But photography
was at work, and in thirty minutes a very
good picture was produced of what had taken
place. This,” he says, “is a remarkable fact;
indeed, it borders on the wonderful, that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
phenomenon invisible to the human eye should
have been, so to speak, seen by the photographic
lens, and a record thereof kept by
chemical agency. It is highly suggestive, and
we may anticipate that it will be turned to
good account by practical philosophers.”</p>

<p>Some very striking phenomena in photographing
the invisible may be produced by
the agency of fluorescence. Figures depicted
upon a background by one or other of certain
substances I shall presently name, although
invisible to the eye, may become visible to the
camera. Of these, the best known, although
not the most effective, is disulphate of quinine.
Such a solution, although to the eye it is colourless
like water, is to the camera as black as
ink. Fill three phials respectively with water,
quinine, and common writing ink, and you
have two whites and one black; but photograph
them, and you have two blacks and
one white. The camera has reduced the transparent
quinine solution to the colour of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
ink. Those of you who may care to experiment
in this direction, please take notice that
the quinine must be acidulated with sulphuric
acid, and that hydrochloric acid, even a small
trace, will destroy this property. Among
other substances that are fluorescent, or that
change the refrangibility of rays of light,
are mineral uranite, certain salts of uranium,
canary glass, alcoholic solution of chlorophyll,
æsculine, tincture of stramonium seeds, and
of turmeric. There are others known to be
still better, but my experiments in this direction
are yet too incomplete to warrant my even
indicating them.</p>

<p>Let me for a moment enter the realm of
speculation, and assume that there are really
spirits invisible to the eye but visible to the
camera and to certain persons called seers or
clairvoyants only. Might we not suggest that
there is some fluorescent compound in the eyes
of such persons not present in those whose eyes
are normal, and that it is to this they owe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
their seeing powers? Some of you may
probably be aware that Dr. Bence Jones and
other philosophers have actually established
the fact of such fluorescent substances being
found in some eyes. May this throw any light
upon the recognised fact of certain animals
being able to see in the dark?</p>

<p>When the subject of fluorescence is more
thoroughly investigated (it is a discovery of
Sir D. Brewster, who was followed by Herschel
and Professor Stokes, and is as yet but of
yesterday), we may hope for a vast accession
to our knowledge of subjects as yet very
slightly understood.</p>

<p>At the Bradford meeting of the British
Association for the Advancement of Science,
in 1873, Dr. Gladstone, F.R.S., demonstrated
before the Mathematical and Physical Section
what I have said respecting invisible drawings
on white cards having produced bold and
clear photographs when no eye could see the
drawings themselves, and I brought away back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
to London these photographs, and, for aught
I know, may have them still.</p>

<p>To prevent this disquisition from being too
dry, I will here introduce a fanciful sketch I
wrote <i lang="la">àpropos</i> of Dr. Gladstone’s demonstration
at the time mentioned:—</p>

<p>A mischievous young lady of scientific
proclivities who attended the meeting of the
British Association, and who was addicted to
practical joking, listened attentively to Dr.
Gladstone’s observations upon the properties
of quinine referred to, and having carefully
noted the discussion that followed, reasoned
within herself thus: If solution of quinine can
make invisible marks upon paper, which will
come out black in a photograph, it ought to
do the same when applied to the skin. So
she procured some of this solution, and upon
her fair brow she painted with it a death’s
head and cross-bones. These, of course, were
invisible to human vision. Thus prepared, she
went to a photographer to have her portrait<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
taken. All went right until the operator went
an to develop the plate, when she soon heard
an altercation between the photographer and
the attendant boy, in which it was evident
that the latter was being charged with having
coated an old or dirty plate.</p>

<p>A second negative was taken, with this
result, that the operator, after bestowing a
puzzled, affrighted look at the lady, rushed
downstairs to the principal of the establishment.
Both returned to the dark room, and
a third negative was taken, when it became
evident that intense excitement was being produced
in the dark room. After an excuse to
the lady about there being electricity in the
atmosphere, which had affected the chemicals,
she was requested to sit once more.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the plate been developed, when
both photographer and assistant rushed out
from the dark room, pale and excited, and
explained that on the brow of the sitter in each
negative was emblazoned the insignia of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
King of Terrors. The negatives were produced
leaving no doubt of the fact. What was to be
done?</p>

<p>The sitter hinted something about not being
disposed to be made a fool of by one who she
was satisfied was a spirit photographer, and that
she, for one, would not allow herself to become
the victim of such absurdity. This upset the
equanimity of the photographer, who expressed
his earnest conviction that she was an emissary
and personal friend of the common enemy of
mankind.</p>

<p>“I shall look in again to-morrow,” said the
lady, in her sweetest tones, “if you promise not
to play any of your silly ghost tricks upon me.”</p>

<p>“Not for ten thousand worlds,” said the
artist, “shall you ever set foot within my studio
again!”</p>

<p>“Oh,” she laughingly rejoined, “I shall drop
in through the roof and visit you some day
when you are disengaged;” and with that she
departed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>“I knew it!” gasped the photographer. “I
felt a sulphurous odour the moment I came
near her. Send immediately for my friend, the
Rev. ——, and get him to offer prayer, and free
the studio from the evil influences remaining
after a visitation from one whose feet, although
clad in boots, would, if examined, be found to
be cloven.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>For several years I have experienced a
strong desire to ascertain by personal investigation
the amount of truth in the ever-recurring
allegation that figures other than those visually
present in the room appeared on a sensitive
plate. The difficulty was to get hold of a
suitable person known as a sensitive or
“medium.” What a medium is, or how physically
or mentally constituted to be different
from other mortals, I am unable to say. He
or she may not be a photographer, but must
be present on each occasion of trial. Some
may be mediums without their being aware
of it. Like the chemical principle known as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
catalysis, they merely act by their presence.
Such a one is Mr. D. of Glasgow, in whose
presence psychic photographs have long been
alleged to be obtained. He was lately in
London on a visit, and a mutual friend got
him to consent to extend his stay in order
that I might try to get a psychic photograph
under test conditions. To this he willingly
agreed. My conditions were exceedingly simple,
were courteously expressed to the host, and
entirely acquiesced in. They were, that I for
the nonce would assume them all to be tricksters,
and, to guard against fraud, should use
my own camera and unopened packages of dry
plates purchased from dealers of repute, and
that I should be excused from allowing a plate
to go out of my own hand till after development,
unless I felt otherwise disposed; but
that, as I was to treat them as under suspicion,
so must they treat me, and that every act I
performed must be in presence of two witnesses,
nay, that I would set a watch upon my own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
camera in the guise of a duplicate one of the
same focus—in other words, I would use a
binocular stereoscopic camera and dictate all
the conditions of operation. All this I was
told was what they very strongly wished me to
do, as they desired to know the truth and that
only. There were present, during one or other
of the evenings when the trials were made,
representatives of various schools of thought,
including a clergyman of the Church of England;
a practitioner of the healing art who is
a fellow of two learned societies; a gentleman
who graduated in the Hall of Science in the
days of the late Charles Bradlaugh; two extremely
hard-headed Glasgow merchants, gentlemen
of commercial eminence and probity; our
host, his wife, the medium, and myself. Dr.
G. was the first sitter, and, for a reason known
to myself, I used a monocular camera. I myself
took the plate out of a packet just previously
ripped up under the surveillance of my
two detectives. I placed the slide in my pocket<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
and exposed it by magnesium ribbon which I
held in my own hand, keeping one eye, as it
were, on the sitter and the other on the camera.
There was no background. I myself took the
plate from the dark slide, and, under the eyes
of the two detectives, placed it in the developing
dish. Between the camera and the sitter a
female figure was developed, rather in a more
pronounced form than that of the sitter. The
lens was a portrait one of short focus; the figure
being somewhat in front of the sitter, was proportionately
larger in dimensions. I submit this
picture (see opposite). It is, as you see, a lady. I
do not recognise her or any of the other figures I
obtained as being like any one I know, and from
my point of view, that of a mere investigator
and experimentalist, not caring whether the
psychic subject were embodied or disembodied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>Many experiments of like nature followed;
on some plates were abnormal appearances, on
others none. All this time Mr. D., the medium,
during the exposure of the plates, was quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
inactive. After one trial, which had proved
successful, I asked him how he felt and what
he had been thinking of during the exposure.
He replied that his thoughts had been mainly
concentrated upon his chances of securing a
corner seat in a smoking carriage that night
from Euston to Glasgow.</p>

<p>If the precautions I took during all of the
several experiments, such as those recorded, are
by any of you thought to have been imperfect
or incomplete, I pray of you to point them out.
In some of them I relaxed my conditions to
the extent of getting one of those present to
lift out from the dark slide the exposed plate
and transfer it to the developing dish held by
myself, or to lift a plate from the manufacturer’s
package into the dark slide held in my own
hand, this being done under my own eye, which
was upon it all the time; but this did not seem
to interfere with the average on-going of the
experiments.</p>

<p>The psychic figures behaved badly. Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
were in focus, others not so; some were lighted
from the right, while the sitter was so from the
left; some were comely, as the dame I shall
show on the screen, others not so; some
monopolised the major portion of the plate,
quite obliterating the material sitters; others
were as if an atrociously badly vignetted portrait,
or one cut oval out of a photograph by a
can-opener, or equally badly clipped out, were
held up behind the sitter. But here is the
point: not one of these figures which came out
so strongly in the negative was visible in any
form or shape to me during the time of exposure
in the camera, and I vouch in the
strongest manner for the fact that no one whatever
had an opportunity of tampering with any
plate anterior to its being placed in the dark
slide or immediately preceding development.
Pictorially they are vile, but how came they
there?</p>

<p>Now, all this time, I imagine you are wondering
how the stereoscopic camera was behaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
itself <em>as such</em>. It is due to the psychic
entities to say that whatever was produced on
one half of the stereoscopic plates was reproduced
on the other, alike good or bad in
definition. But on a careful examination of one
which was rather better than the other, and which
is now about to be projected on the lantern screen
for your examination (<a href="#Page_35">see page 35</a>), I deduce
this fact, that the impressing of the spirit form
was not consentaneous with that of the sitter.
This I consider an important discovery. I
carefully examined one in the stereoscope, and
found that, while the two sitters were stereoscopic
<i lang="la">per se</i>, the psychic figure was absolutely
flat. I also found that the psychic figure was
at least a millimetre higher up in one than the
other. Now, as both had been simultaneously
exposed, it follows to demonstration that,
although both were correctly placed vertically
in relation to the particular sitter behind whom
the figure appeared, and not so horizontally,
this figure had not only <em>not</em> been impressed on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the plate simultaneously with the two gentlemen
forming the group, but had not been
formed by the lens at all, and that, therefore
the psychic image might be produced without
a camera. I think this is a fair deduction.
But still the question obtrudes, How came
these figures there? I again assert that the
plates were not tampered with by either myself
or any one present. Are they crystallisations
of thought? Have lens and light really nothing
to do with their formation? The whole subject
was mysterious enough on the hypothesis of
an invisible spirit, whether a thought projection
or an actual spirit, being really there in the
vicinity of the sitter, but it is now a thousand
times more so. There are plenty of Tycho
Brahes capable of supplying details of observations,
but who is to be the Kepler that will
from such observations evolve a law by which
they can be satisfactorily explained?</p>

a photographic experiment open to every one

<h3 id="REMARKS">REMARKS BY MEMBERS AND VISITORS.</h3>

<p>Having finished the reading of his paper,
Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span> exhibited by the aid of the lantern,
slides from some of the negatives he had
obtained. A series of “Spirit Photographs,” the
work of Mr. Hudson, formerly of Holloway
Road, and some French photographers, were
also shown by Mr. Maltby, a visitor, who was
introduced by Mr. Taylor.</p>

<p>Messrs. Downey, P. Everitt, W. E. Debenham,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
F. A. Bridge, A. Cowan, A. Haddon, J. S.
Teape, A. Mackie, and others took part in the
meeting, but their remarks, for the most part,
were characteristic of unacquaintance with the
subject.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">A. Glendinning</span> explained that it
had originally been intended to have had the
photographs taken in the studio of a West-end
photographer, but that gentleman had withdrawn
his consent owing to his religious views,
expressing the opinion that such experiments
were dangerous, if not wicked. The experiments
were therefore made in the drawing-room
of a house in Dalston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">W. E. Debenham</span> asked if it would be
possible to repeat the experiments in the presence
of the same medium and two members
of the London and Provincial Photographic
Association.</p>

<p>[This question was answered at a later
period of the meeting, when the suggestion
was made by the Chairman.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Glendinning</span> said he had been interested
in the subject of psychic photography
for twenty-eight years, and he asked permission
from the Chairman to make a few remarks.
This being readily and courteously granted, he
said, “Do the members of this Society, who are
now present, believe that Mr. Taylor is competent
for the investigation which he recently
undertook? I do not mean, are you prepared
to endorse his statements regarding the results
of his recent experiments? I do not mean
merely, do you consider Mr. Taylor an honest
investigator? There are many honest men who
would not be considered qualified to watch with
sufficient care and accuracy experiments in
photographic manipulations. There are others
who are honest and upright, and who are skilful
in the ordinary routine of photographic work,
who may possess very little knowledge of
chemistry or of optics, in their relation to
practical photography. Others, again, may be
honest men, skilful manipulators, and adepts in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
chemistry and in optics, but too opinionative
to conduct such experiments as those under
consideration. Well, then, gentlemen, looking
at the matter all round, I put it to you this way.
My own belief, my strong conviction, is this,
that Mr. Taylor is well qualified in every respect
for the very important and, I would add, the
very solemn task which he undertook. A man
with an open mind, prepared to—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘Accept the truth where’er ’tis found,</div>
<div class="verse">On Christian or on heathen ground?’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">possessed of shrewdness, tact, an eye like a
hawk’s, watchful and ready to detect the
slightest attempt at trickery or fraud, with an
integrity of purpose and an independent
outspokenness which would lead him fearlessly
to expose and denounce those who
would so far forget themselves as to trifle
with the most sacred feelings of our nature,
by attempting to palm off as abnormal and
strange that which is but a miserable counterfeit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
of a grand reality. Gentlemen, do you
uphold me in my view that Mr. Taylor was
the right man for the experiments to which
reference has been made? (Applause and
expressions of approval.) I thank you for
this expression of your opinion. I do not
wish to corner you; I do not wish to trap
you into a seeming acquiescence with views
which you have not considered. My desire
is to be perfectly frank; but there are reasons,
into which I need not enter now, why I have
put before you the statements and the question
to which you have responded. Well,
supposing for the moment that Mr. Taylor’s
report of his experiments is an accurate
statement, that portraits have appeared on his
plates, and have been printed from his plates,
which cannot be accounted for by any known
agency, it seems to me to be a fair conclusion
to arrive at, that there were other persons
present at those experiments besides the ladies
and gentlemen who could be seen with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
normal vision; that these unseen visitors were
exhibiting an active and intelligent interest in
the matter, and that they were aiding by
their co-operation to produce the abnormal
images which appeared on the plates. Call
these unseen visitors by the name which may
commend itself to you as most fairly descriptive;
call them spooks, or ghosts, or astrals,
or elementals, or even, if you prefer to do so,
call them devils. I call them spirit friends—ex-carnated
human beings—that is what they
profess to be, and that is what, in an experience
of such matters extending over a
good many years, I have always had good
reason to believe them to be. Therefore I
transfer the name from the principal operators
to the pictures themselves, and I call the
latter spirit photographs. Likewise, because
the abnormal portraits, so far as they have
been recognised, are portraits of persons who
have cast off the earthly tabernacle, I claim
that the name spirit photographs, or photographs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
of spirits, is as near as we can get to
accuracy in the present state of our knowledge.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">F. A. Bridge</span> said they were bound
to believe Mr. Taylor’s statement; but, as
practical photographers, though the pictures
shown <em>might</em> be spirit photographs, he thought
they gave them the idea of cut-out prints, but
as to who cut them out he did not know and
did not care. He, however, did not for one
moment wish to impute any complicity or
dishonesty to Mr. Glendinning in connexion
with the experiments, for that gentleman
appeared (as he had said) merely to have
been desirous of arriving at the truth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Debenham</span> quite agreed with Mr.
Bridge as to Mr. Glendinning’s <i lang="la">bonâ fides</i> in
the matter. He would propose, if possible, a
committee be formed to be present at some
similar séance.</p>

<p>A <span class="smcap">Member</span> stated that Mr. Taylor’s experiments
had been vitiated to some extent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
by his not having the whole of the conditions
under his own control (a remark to which Mr.
Taylor does not seem to have thought it
necessary to reply, as he had already distinctly
stated that the <em>whole</em> of the conditions
were subject to his entire control).</p>

<p>Professor <span class="smcap">A. Haddon</span> observed that if spirits
gave out ultra-violet rays, it would be advisable
to use lenses made of quartz, as they would
have a far better way of rendering such subjects
on the plate than with ordinary lenses,
which cut off ultra-violet. Again, had different
eyes different powers as regards the taking in
and cutting out of different rays? Mr. Friese
Greene had shown how it was possible to
allow an impression to be made on the retina,
and then to be transferred to a plate. Most
probably only certain people possessed this
power, for it was curious no one had repeated
the experiment with success.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">T. Shorter</span> said he had had some
experience of the subject, and in many instances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
such portraits had been distinctly
recognised as those of relatives and friends,
and it was not by any means a peculiar
experience. The late Mr. Beattie, of Clifton,
obtained portraits of this kind through Mr.
Hudson, to whom he went in a very sceptical
spirit. Hudson allowed him to go through
all the manipulations himself; Mr. Beattie
took his own plates, and inverted them before
they were exposed. On one picture, after it
was taken he recognised the portrait of his
own brother. He (Mr. Shorter) knew of a
good many instances of a similar kind. For
instance, he said, Dr. Alfred Russel Wallace
had had no hesitation in recognising portraits
so obtained. Of course there were many taken
in this way that could not be identified; but,
on the other hand, there were many that
could. He could quote forty instances where
people could identify them.</p>

<p>A <span class="smcap">Member</span> explained how a collection
of portraits of deceased persons can be made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
by professional photographers. He stated
his firm sometimes receive such portraits to
copy, and at times when they deliver the
copies they pretend that the original pictures
are lost or injured; so the customers have
nothing to compare the copies with. This
brought forth the rebuke from Mr. Maltby
(a visitor) that the conduct of the firm
might be “smart,” but could not be considered
honest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arthur Maltby</span> said the spirit
forms which are photographed were created
from the aura that escapes from sensitive
subjects. Some years ago a gentleman went
to a photographer to have a portrait taken,
and, instead of his portrait appearing, as he
expected, that of a man who had been abroad
for many years, and of whom he knew nothing,
appeared on the plate. Some weeks afterwards
a telegram came announcing that the
man, whose spirit photograph had appeared
on the plate, was shot. Again, during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
last Austrian war, an officer who had never
been photographed in his regimentals appeared
to a brother officer as a photographed spirit.
On one occasion the figure of a small child
appeared in the centre of a picture. The
child had been dead nearly fifty years, but
was recognised after that lapse of time. He
suggested that a photograph could be taken
to prove that fluid rays pass from a sensitive,
like photographic rays of light. This aura,
which was the material emanating from all
parts of the body, was collected to form the
portraits of those who wished to prove the
immortality of the soul.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">J. Weir Brown</span> (the chairman) said
that although the pictures shown that night
by Mr. Maltby might be recognised as spirit
photographs, they had only to do with Mr. Traill
Taylor’s experiments,<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and he was bound to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
say that some of the examples shown bore
evidence of being patchwork on the plates,
and not similar to those that were shown by
Mr. Maltby. Mr. Taylor’s results were very
mysterious; and, although Mr. Taylor himself
was very watchful, there was nothing to lead
them to any conclusion on the matter, so that
it must remain a mystery. He suggested
that Mr. Glendinning should provide an occasion,
if he could, for the London and Provincial
Photographic Association to send a
small committee to take part in similar experiments,
and he was sure that they would only
send fair-minded men to represent them.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Glendinning</span>, in reply, said he would
be willing to use his influence to get such
experiments carried on in the presence of the
same medium later in the year. (Hear, hear.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
He said that his friend, the medium, had so
much confidence in Mr. Traill Taylor, that
probably he would carefully consider Mr.
Taylor’s suggestions in the matter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span> asked why they should expect
Mr. Glendinning, who is not a member of the
society, to be at the trouble for them. He
suggested that the society appoint a committee
to investigate the subject, and advertise for
the services of a suitable medium with whom
to try experiments.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap"><i>Portrait obtained without Exposure in
the Camera.</i></span><a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></h3>

<p>Towards the close of the proceedings, Mr.
Glendinning handed to the chairman, and to
some of the members sitting near him, a print
of a psychic portrait from a negative obtained
without the plate being exposed in the camera,
or to light of any kind excepting that given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
by a nightlight in a dark lantern to develop
by. The experiment was made in consequence
of a conversation with Mr. Taylor (after his
experiments were concluded), and about an
hour before the medium left for his return
journey.</p>

<p>An Ilford dry plate had been taken by Mr.
Glendinning from a new packet, put in clean
paper, and held by the medium, in the dark
room, between the palms of his hands; Mr.
Glendinning placed his hands above and below
those of the medium; he then took the plate
and placed it in his developing tray, when a
full-length figure appeared, clear and distinct,
although without artistic effect. The negative
was in Mr. Taylor’s possession at the meeting.</p>

<p>The proceedings closed with a vote of
thanks to Mr. Taylor for his paper.</p>

<p class="tb"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—With regard to one or more of the
psychic portraits taken by Mr. Taylor on his
own plates, in which he found that the psychic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
image had not been formed by the lens at
all, and with regard to the important discovery
made by Mr. Glendinning, in a later experiment
with his friend, the medium, it would
be a mistake to conclude that the psychic
images on photographic plates are always
produced in this way. There are many spirit
photographs, regarding which all the evidence
is in favour of the theory that they are produced
by the agency of the camera at the same time
as the sitters. With respect to one of the
pictures taken by Mr. Taylor, and shown by
him on the lantern screen, the sitter, after
Mr. Taylor left the room to develop the plate,
stated to those present that there ought to be
on the plate a spirit form to his right and
nearer the camera than himself, as he felt
“drapery like a robe of silky crape pass him
at the right side when the photograph was
being taken.” When Mr. Taylor appeared
with the developed picture, it showed a full-length
female form, with a white robe, but no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
drapery about the head or shoulders. The
sitter further stated that, during the exposure
of the plate, his mind was occupied in calculating
some sums in arithmetic, so that the
psychic form could not be considered to be a
photographic representation of his thoughts.</p>

<h3><i>From <span class="smcap">The Practical Photographer</span>,
April, 1893.</i><a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></h3>

<p>Psychic Photography.—At a recent
London and Provincial meeting, Mr. J. Traill
Taylor showed some negatives of what are
commonly called “spirit photographs,” which
he had taken under test conditions. He had
bought ordinary commercial plates from a
well-known commercial dealer, and exposed
them at a recent séance held in the north
of London. He took his own stereoscopic
camera, opened the original packets of plates
and filled the slides himself in the presence
of two gentlemen. He exposed them by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
magnesium light upon two sitters, one of
whom was alleged to be a “medium,” and
immediately developed them himself. On
development some of them showed other
figures (in addition to those of the sitters)
which had not been visibly present when the
exposure was made. The exposures were made
in the afternoon in an ordinary drawing-room,
when it was far from dark, and the magnesium
light was supplementary to the daylight.
Prints from the resulting negatives, viewed in
the stereoscope, showed the sitters in relief,
but the “ghosts” with the appearance of
flatness. We are almost surprised at Mr.
Taylor’s temerity in bringing forward such a
subject before such an audience, when he knows
full well the unreasoning prejudice with which
the subject is met. Like the brothers of Dives,
“they would not be persuaded, though one
rose from the dead.” We do not imagine
that Mr. Taylor wished to convince his hearers
of anything, but surely he was over-sanguine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
if he even expected fair investigation or
criticism. Before he came forward in this
matter, he would have been taken as a competent
investigator—in fact, the meeting in
question passed a resolution to the effect that
he was a “reliable person, and a gentleman
well qualified to conduct such an experiment
as had been described.” Yet, when he states
that fraud was impossible, he is at once condemned
as either an incompetent or an impostor—preferably
the former. A committee
was appointed to investigate the matter. Will
they be believed if they give a report similar to
that of Mr. Taylor’s? Or will they only be believed
if they give the report that is expected?</p>

<p>Referring to the unsuccessful attempt made
in another photographic journal to throw doubt
upon Mr. Taylor’s experiments by raising a
cry of trickery, the <cite>Practical Photographer</cite>
makes this sensible observation:—</p>

<p>“Surely this is a miserable evasion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
main point at issue, which is not whether the
medium was capable of fraud if he got the
chance, but whether Mr. Taylor is believable
when he asserts that the chance for fraud was
not given.”</p>

<p>In the May issue of the same journal there
is the following:—</p>

<p>“Five correspondents write on this head;
but they only bring forward experiences of
many years ago, references to the <cite>News</cite> and
<cite>Journal</cite> of old dates, and similar evidence.
The letters are interesting, but we cannot find
room for a correspondence on the subject. Of
testimony there is more than enough. Those
who can be convinced by testimony are
probably convinced already, if they have
examined the subject. If the matter is to
be advanced further, it must be by careful
experiments under test conditions, and such
experiments will not satisfy the active objectors
unless they can be repeated to order, and, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
far as we know, no one has claimed to be
able to do this. Only new tests, well authenticated,
are of use in our columns at present.
Any such we are prepared to publish, with
reproduction of the alleged psychic photographs
if desired.”</p>

<h3><i><span class="smcap">The Review of Reviews</span>, April, 1893.</i></h3>

<p>In the <cite>Review of Reviews</cite><a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> for April, there
is a reproduction of one of the spirit photographs
taken by Mr. Traill Taylor, and also
of the portrait obtained by Mr. Glendinning
and Mr. Duguid, without the use of a camera,
and without exposing the prepared dry plate
to light until after it was developed and fixed.
Mr. Stead refers to Mr. Taylor as a well-known
photographic journalist, of unquestionable good
faith, and prints the details of the experiments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
as given in Mr. Taylor’s paper. Dr. Alfred
Russel Wallace, F.R.S., who has had much experience
in this subject, and possesses a large
collection of spirit photographs, thinks the most
interesting results of the recent experiments are
those in which the form of one of the sitters
is blended with the form of the psychic portrait;
but Mr. Stead thinks the portrait obtained
without the camera the most interesting. He
concludes his article thus:—</p>

<p>“Mr. Glendinning assures me most positively
that the plate had not been tampered
with. If so, it is to be hoped Mr. Duguid
will repeat the last experiment under test
conditions. It is much the most interesting
of the lot.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>“The illustrations are badly developed, but
they suffice to show that the plate was sensitive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
to the presence of entities invisible to the
human eye. Everything, of course, depends
upon the accuracy and honesty of the photographer;
and the reputation of Mr. Taylor
and Mr. Glendinning is above reproach.”</p>

<h3><i>From <span class="smcap">The Morning</span>, April 4th, 1893.</i></h3>

<p>The recent lecture on “Spirit Photography,”
given by Mr. J. Traill Taylor before a large
audience, composed of the members of the
London and Provincial Photographic Association
and their friends, is being much talked
about in photographic circles. Mr. Taylor,
whose personal <i lang="la">bonâ fides</i> in the matter are
admitted to be quite above suspicion, showed
upon an ordinary lantern screen the results
which he had obtained. The conditions under
which the spirit experiments were conducted
were as follows:—Mr. Taylor used his own
binocular stereoscopic camera, and provided
himself with unopened packages of “Ilford”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
dry plates, purchased from dealers of repute.
He exposed the plates by means of magnesium
ribbon in the presence of a medium.
At the first attempt, between the camera and
the sitter a female figure was developed. On
several of the other plates exposed various
figures were also discovered. It was distinctly
asserted by Mr. Taylor that none of these
were visible to him at any time during the
exposure in the camera, and he vouched that
no one had the slightest opportunity of
tampering with the plates before they were
placed in the dark slide or immediately preceding
development.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Experiments in Spirit Photography.</span>—We
call attention to certain important
points in Mr. Taylor’s paper and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
remarks which follow it. The first consideration
is, that nothing should be jumped at as
fraud, though it may appear to be so. Mr.
Taylor has taken a strong, manly position in
exhibiting photographs which have all the
appearance of being spurious, and yet he
knows they are not so. A man in a position
less eminent could not afford to be so bold.
Mr. Glendinning dwells on this feature of the
investigation in an excellent manner.</p>

<p>The photograph obtained without exposure
at all, described at the close of the report,
suggests a means of producing pictures quite
unknown to science or photographic art. It,
in its way, resembles the direct writing on
closed slates, or on unopened packets of paper.
But on carefully examining Mr. Taylor’s negatives
it appears as if the spirit figures had not
been cut out and stuck on, but there is a
blending of the one picture with the other,
showing plainly that a different mode of
operation was at work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>We have often observed in our lectures
that the nature of the image differs in the
pictures of every spirit photographer. Evidently
the photographers on the other side
have taken up Mr. Taylor’s challenge to investigate
in a very serious manner, and have
shown some of their skill to set the brains of
mortal photographers on the alert for a more
comprehensive knowledge of the possibilities
involved in their art.</p>

<p>Let this thought dwell in the mind of
every reader, that many of the so-called
“frauds” attributed to spiritual experiment
have not been frauds at all, but the hasty
conclusions of that unworthy suspicion which
is begotten of ignorance. Such conclusions
bring the subject to a standstill, whereas a
tentative and trustful investigation would lead
to most important discoveries. We rejoice to
see the healthy direction which the present
experiments have taken.</p>

<p>We invite the special attention of our
readers to a report in our present issue, of
experiments in “Psychic Photography,” conducted
by Mr. J. Traill Taylor. Never before,
so far as we are aware, has the investigation
of this, one of the most interesting of Spiritualistic
phenomena, been undertaken by a man
so competent in every way for the work,
enjoying, as he does, a high reputation for
his scientific attainments in his own special
department, and for his powers of keen and
careful observation. Using his own camera
and plates, and conducting the operations with
his own hands, he succeeded in photographing
figures, “not one of which,” he avers, “had
been visible in any form or shape during the
time of exposure in the camera.” But more
than this, by observing the results on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
occasion when a stereoscopic camera was employed,
he arrived at the conclusion that—as
some Spiritualists have long thought to be
probable—the figure developed had not been
formed by the lens, and the psychic image
might be produced without the camera at all.
It will be interesting to observe what Mr.
Taylor’s photographic brethren will have to
say to him; for ourselves we tender him our
hearty thanks.</p>

<h3><i>From <span class="smcap">Light</span>, March 25th, 1893.</i></h3>

<p>The importance of this address can scarcely
be exaggerated, and for two reasons,—one,
that we have a scientific photographer, of the
first rank, treating the subject publicly before
a body of men, the majority of whom would,
presumably, be at least sceptical; and, next,
that in the address there were advanced certain
speculations which may not only help to the
elucidation of the means whereby such photographs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
are produced, but also throw light upon
the great problem of Spiritualism itself.</p>

<p>Of the experiments which have been
already described we have nothing to say,
except that, unless fraud be admitted as
having been possible, figures were produced
on the plates which could only have got
there in some abnormal way. Fraud, however,
seems to have been about as impossible as it
could be under any circumstances whatever.
Mr. Taylor used his own camera. The plates
were bought from dealers of repute, and the
parcel was opened in view of two witnesses,
witnesses above suspicion. Mr. Taylor insisted
that he should keep the plates in his own
hands until after development, and this caution
he relaxed only so far as getting one of those
present to lift out from the dark slide the
exposed plate and transfer it to the developing
dish held by himself, or to transfer a plate
from the manufacturer’s package into the dark
slide held by his own hand. Unless, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
there had been connivance on the part of the
“dealers of repute” who supplied the plates,
which is out of the question, or the persons
present were all of them leagued together to
cheat, we are forced to the conclusion that
the results were genuine....</p>

<p>A few more words must be given to Mr.
Traill Taylor. The importance of his lectures
has been dealt with elsewhere, but it can bear
emphasising here. Facts, or what appear to
be facts, we have in plenty, but the explanation
of these facts, except theoretically, is not
so common. Anything which sheds even the
faintest glimmer on the meaning of these
facts is supremely welcome, and this glimmer,
or more than glimmer, Mr. Taylor has produced.
It will be strange if that “fluorescence”
which has been so relied upon for the general
theory of fraud should turn out to be the
means of demonstrating the opposite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>From <span class="smcap">Light</span>, May 6th, 1893.</i></h3>

<p>It was not to be expected that Mr. Traill
Taylor’s photographs would be left unchallenged.
But as it is impossible to impute
fraud to Mr. Taylor or his associates, the
objectors are thrown back on somewhat flimsy
arguments. A letter to the <cite>Christian World</cite>
may perhaps be taken fairly well to represent
the kind of argument. The letter is signed
“F. Gass.”</p>

<p>Of course we know that fraudulent spirit
photographs have been plentifully sold, but
because there is a large amount of falsehood
in the world it does not follow that there is
no truth. But let us see how Mr. Taylor is
treated by this critic: “Mr. Taylor says these
forms were invisible to watchers in the room,
and were, therefore, disembodied spirits.”</p>

<p>There is no such “therefore” in Mr. Taylor’s
address. What he did say was: “In the foregoing
I have confined myself as closely as
possible to narrating how I conducted a photographic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
experiment open to every one to make,
avoiding stating any hypothesis or belief of
my own on the subject generally.”</p>

<p>The writer takes exception to Mr. Taylor’s
statement that the figures when examined by
the stereoscope were absolutely flat; because
“the figures were solid enough to obscure a
view of the sitting medium when they stood
between him and the camera.” That is, Mr.
Gass knows all about solidity, and what could
or could not be done by what Mr. Taylor is
careful to call a “psychic entity.” That
there is any appearance of light and shade in
the engraving as it is in the <cite>Review of Reviews</cite>
proves nothing; even if it is there, we have
Mr. Taylor’s assertion that in the photograph
he examined with the stereoscope the “psychic
figure was absolutely flat.” As to the nonsense
about the clothing of the figures and the
draper’s shops in Ghost-land we have nothing
to say. Mr. Gass then falls foul of photographs
being taken without the employment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
of a lens. Such a thing would be a miracle.
So Mr. Gass knows what a miracle is. “To
obtain a portrait on a plate, light is imperatively
necessary, and to obtain an image of
a figure it must be brought into focus by the
lens of a camera.” Of course, if these things
“must” be so, there is an end of the matter,
but the experiment went to disprove the
necessity of this “must.” And what is
“light”? Has Mr. Gass any knowledge of
the spectrum, and could he himself “see”
the actinic rays which produce the pictures
on the sensitised plate?</p>

<p>Mr. Taylor is, perhaps, the most competent

and scientific photographer, has undertaken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>

</div>

<p>Ever since the appearance of the more
than sensational “Real Ghost Stories”
and “More Ghost Stories”—which are, like
the ghosts, still appearing—a great and calm
tolerance of the occult made manifest seems
to have diffused itself throughout English
society. People are bringing out their own
private little bogey stories, of which they used
to be quite ashamed, and, what is more
curious, they are bringing out their bogey
photos, both of which things reveal the fact
how many more ghost stories and ghost photos
are about than people seem generally to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
imagined. Only the other day I was told
of a young lady who went down to Brighton
to an ordinary photographer. She sat as an
ordinary sitter, suspecting nothing. The plate
came out blurred all over; photographer surprised,
and on point of casting plate aside,
when sitter begs to see it, and further begs to
have it printed off. Result—photo blurred all
over, sitter unrecognisable; when subjected to
high magnifyer, milky way of blue reveals
innumerable faces, but all the same face!
Recognised by young lady at once as face of
dead lover. This is the kind of story which
is becoming tiresomely common, and often
bewilderingly well evidenced.</p>

<p>Now, unless I had thought this question
of alleged appearances—palpable enough to
be seen, perhaps photographed—might have
a grave side to it, I should not have for two
Sundays rung the changes, and the <i lang="la">pros</i>
and <i lang="la">cons.</i> in the pulpit, and pointed out the
momentous connexion between such manifestations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
and our interests here and hereafter.
People seemed much impressed with this view.
The fact is that every time I announced the
subject at St. James’s, Westmoreland Street,
Marylebone, crowds were unable to get seats,
and I was in a way compelled to resume the
topic next Sunday, while thousands struggled
in vain to get into my tolerably spacious vestry
after the sermon to catch glimpses of the
selected photos and spirit drawings there exposed
to view. Well, this shows, I suppose,
that I had, if possible, under-estimated the
toleration which I solicited for this dubious
subject, but which I hardly expected to win.</p>

<h3><i><span class="smcap">“Will you Show me the Ghost?”</span></i></h3>

<p>The physical philosopher (and we are all
physical philosophers, whatever else we may
be) naturally asks, when he is told that this
or that person has seen a ghost, “Will you
show me the ghost?” Sometimes he is informed
that if he sleeps in the haunted room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
he will be quite satisfied. Sometimes he does,
and isn’t—sometimes he does, and <em>is</em>; when
he <em>is</em>, like a wise man he is apt to keep what
he has seen (as Johnson said every man did
his religion) to himself. Perhaps he may have
been in the habit of laughing at ghosts and
sneering at people who believed in them, and
doesn’t want to eat his own words. Perhaps
he resembles the man who said “he did not
believe in ghosts, but was very much afraid
of them;” or, perhaps, he had no taste, after
making a full confession about what he may
have seen, for the retort courteous, that he was
probably a fool or a liar—or both. Anyhow,
the physical philosopher might next inquire,
Did several people see the ghost at once, or
independently at different times? Is there
reason—that is to say—to suppose the ghost
was really an objective (external to the spectator)
or merely a subjective hallucination?
A very reasonable inquiry. “Photograph me
a ghost; chemicals have no fancies, plates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
don’t get nervous, and lenses tell no lies!”
Good. So we proceed to get a medium into
the studio; we photograph away, and a ghost
comes out behind the medium!</p>

<p>“Ah! but did you examine the plate before
it was slipped in?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then the plate was cooked; the ghost
was already on it.”</p>

<p>“Try again.” This time you bring your
own plate; but again comes a ghost.</p>

<p>“Ah! but did you change the screen behind
you—shift it, or put your own screen?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Well, the ghost was in chemicals on the
screen.”</p>

<p>So next time you remove the photographer’s
screen, and put your own, and bring your own
plate, too; but again comes a ghost.</p>

<p>“Ah! but did you examine the inside of
the camera? Did you watch the developing
process? Did you watch your plate from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
beginning to end? Nay, did you spy everything—windows,
&amp;c.—outside thoroughly?
A ghost might be shot on to the exposed
camera. Did you allow any one to dress up
in a sheet behind you, and do the partial exposure
trick?”</p>

<p>Well, next time you take every precaution,
and if still you get a ghost, “that gives to
reflect,” as the French say; so let us reflect a
little.</p>

<h3><i><span class="smcap">“Authentic” Ghost Photos.</span></i></h3>

<p>The most authentic ghost photos are the
hardest to get hold of. They are in the hands
of private amateur photographers, who are shy
of lending or showing them because they are
shy of being accused of fraud or folly; besides,
to them these photos are often sacred, or they
seem to portray the features of the beloved
dead. I believe Mr. Crookes, F.R.S., one of
the greatest scientists living—the renowned inventor
of the radiometer—has obtained spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
photos of a materialised form that appeared
apart from the medium, and moved about the
room freely while a continuous current of
electricity was being passed through the entranced
medium, so that she could not move
without betraying the motion. But, like the
wise man he is, Mr. Crookes, after having
tasted the quality of scientific bigotry, and
already suffered somewhat for his ardour in
the pursuit of unpopular and novel truth—Mr.
Crookes, I say, keeps certain experiences,
together with his abnormal photos, to himself,
and will not now even show them. It is of
no importance to him what those who do not
and cannot know the facts think about them.
They belong to his laboratory work. Why
should he bother himself with a crowd of
outsiders? Of course, no spirit photo, of
itself, can bear conviction, nor is it possible
to produce about it in a journal any evidence
that will. The two spirit photos I have been
prevailed upon to allow the Editor of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
<cite>Daily Graphic</cite> to use with this open letter are,
nevertheless, of considerable interest. (1) The
lady seated went with her daughter. She
did not tell the photographer who was in her
thoughts. She thought of and longed for her
father to appear. She did not even tell her
daughter or any one else the mental test.
She thought that her father should appear
wearing a peculiar black cap which he commonly
used during the last days of his illness.
That test was never revealed before the plate
was developed; but it was answered, as may
be seen in the photo (see opposite); the features
also are too marked to allow of any doubt.</p>

<h3><i><span class="smcap">The Late Editor of “Light.”</span></i></h3>

<p>The picture on page 83 represents Mr.
Stainton Moses and a figure unknown to him.
The accomplished Editor of <cite>Light</cite> is best known
to the public as M.A. Oxon. The Rev. Stainton
Moses, a graduate of Oxford University, was for
many years Classical and English master at University<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
College, London. From his investigations
he became convinced of the general
truths of what is vaguely called Spiritualism,
and has devoted himself for some twenty
years to making the public familiar with the
higher aspects, while warning them against
its ridiculous, dangerous, or degrading tendencies.
The only interest of the photo is that
it was taken under all those strict test conditions
which I have alluded to above in this
open letter. The chief professional spirit
photographers are M. Buguet, of Paris,
frightened by the priest into a recantation
of his spirit photos, which recantation no one
who tested Buguet believes any more than
does Buguet himself; Mr. Hudson, who was,
I am told, not always above suspicion, but,
like other mediums, was also successful under
rigid test conditions; Mumler, Beattie, and
many others I know nothing about. Mr.
Stead is now occupied in testing spirit photography,
and that being the case, we are soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
likely to hear more about it from an abler
pen than mine. So great was the interest
shown in the labelled spirit photos and the
spirit drawings by the late Mrs. Watts,
daughter of William and Mary Howitt, exposed
in my vestry, St. James’s, Westmoreland
Street, Marylebone, that I kept them up
for a second Sunday. There is nothing like
publicity as a means of getting at truth. Let
in the light! Sift facts! “Prove all things;
hold fast that which is good.”—1 Thess. v. 21.</p>

<h2 id="SPIRIT_PHOTOGRAPHY">SPIRIT PHOTOGRAPHY.</h2>

<p class="author"><i>By</i> <span class="smcap">Jas. Robertson</span>, <i>Glasgow</i>.</p>

<p>The most striking phenomena associated
with what comes under the name of
Spiritualism are those connected with photography.
It was very naturally thought that
nothing was so capable of bringing conviction
to the inquirer as a record made by the
camera, which might be considered free from
all imagination, unconscious cerebration, expectancy,
&amp;c., and yet there has been no part
of the phenomena that has been more fiercely
assailed as being fraudulent. No matter how
clear and searching and honest has been the
experimenter, if success attends his work suspicion
and cruel innuendo invariably follow him.
The truths pertaining to the spiritual are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
received in the same calm, critical, and philosophic
spirit as the discoveries that are presented
in other realms. People gladly welcome a new
planet, or a new metal, and laud the discoverer;
but the explorer in spiritual phenomena is at
once set down as either a madman or a fraudulent
person. One can scarcely estimate the loss
the world has sustained by its want of fair
treatment; sensitive souls fear to speak out and
tell all they know. Robert Chambers kept his
Spiritualism in the background, and walked
through life honoured and respected, but he
made the battle of unpopular truth all the more
difficult to fight for the men and women who
did speak out. Spiritualists, though set down
as credulous, are as far removed from this condition
as it is possible to be; they have had to
fight their way step by step, critically examining,
but honestly yielding when the facts were too
much for them.</p>

<p>Very many photographic artists are in their
ranks who have again and again met with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
strange and weird markings on the sensitive
plate, which they could not understand; they
have sought only to get at the truth. Fraud lives
but for the hour, and the person who has joined
the ranks of an unpopular cause knows that a
fierce light will beat upon all his actions, so that
he need be more than ordinarily cautious in all
he sets down; but though bogus spirit pictures
can be made, must we cease to present those
which are got by honest people under conditions
that have been considered perfect? Over
twenty years since, in New York, a photographer
named Wm. H. Mumler succeeded in
getting hundreds of pictures of the so-called
dead, which were recognised by their friends as
portraits; the great body of people who went
to him were total strangers, one of them, thickly
veiled, being the wife of the murdered President
Lincoln. On the plate was seen her husband
and one of her children, who had passed on. I
had the good fortune to come in contact with
those who went to Mr. Mumler shortly after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
arriving in New York, and who got test pictures
which were beyond cavil or suspicion. In
hundreds of cases the camera saw and reported
what the physical senses did not cognise.</p>

<p>Mr. Mumler’s success brought him only
hardship and excessive pain; he was dragged
into the law courts and fiercely assailed as an
impostor, but the volume of evidence which was
brought in his favour so vindicated his character
that he triumphed. In our own country
again and again we have had photographers,
amateur and professional, who have met with
these forms on their plates.</p>

<p>Mr. Hudson, of London, got many test
pictures, and a whole crowd of eminent people
have vouched for the reality of the likenesses of
their deceased friends.</p>

<p>Mr. John Beattie, of Clifton, a retired photographer
of twenty years’ experience, a man
thoughtful and skilful, along with his friend Dr.
Thompson, made experiments in spirit photography
for their own private satisfaction, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
placed on record details of their patience and
ultimate success. Forms again and again, some
fragmentary, faint, and shadowy, some full and
clear, appeared on the plate, fully attesting that
spirit photography was real.</p>

<p>The late editor of <cite>Light</cite>, Rev. Stainton
Moses, M.A., had a most extensive experience,
and brought a clear and searching intellect to
bear upon it. His series of papers dealing
with the subject is careful and complete in all
details, and shows with what patience and
care the spiritual investigator examines the
ground before he gives forth his conclusions.
In his experiments he ofttimes saw the figures
which afterwards made their appearance on the
plate.</p>

<p>My own opportunities for the observation of
the reality of the phenomena have been good.
Brought into close and daily contact with Mr.
David Duguid, through our business relations,
I have been able to witness almost all the
pictures which have been taken through his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
mediumship. He has been most averse all
the time to give sittings, as he fully knows the
amount of suspicion which must gather, and the
annoyance that will be created, however successful;
yet still he is anxious to perform his
share in the work of demonstrating human immortality.
It seems hard that the spiritual
medium, of all persons, should have the taint
of suspicion cast around him. Spiritualists
themselves have come from such a sceptical,
materialistic side of human experience, that
they are suspicious of each bit of phenomena
which has not hitherto come under their gaze.
It must not be overlooked that the bulk of
exposures have been the result of the actions
of spiritualists who would have nothing but
what is genuine.</p>

<p>Some years since Mr. Duguid yielded to the
strong pressure that was brought to bear, and
took at intervals pictures on which appeared
other forms than those seen by the physical
senses. Each effort was not a success. Again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
and again have we gone into the developing
chamber, only to find there was but the physical
sitter. On all these occasions we took the
utmost care to be able to vouch for the conditions
under which they were taken, so as to
meet the naturally critical questions which would
be put. Mr. Andrew Glendinning, of London,
who has been on the closest terms of friendship
with Mr. Duguid for over thirty years, used to
come down, and at such times the latter yielded
to the request for a sitting.</p>

<p>Mr. Glendinning brought his own plates,
took every precaution that they should not pass
out of his sight—not that he suspected anything
wrong, but that he might make his testimony
of value. We had on almost every visit the
most marked success. During the process I
was often conscious of the presence of spirit
people before they made their appearance on
the plate; people who were known in the flesh
and others came in this mysterious way, and
clearly showed that death must be some other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
thing than what was made out by popular
theologies. As the Rev. John Page Hopps
says, “A future life means persistence of life,
means that the spirit self remains a conscious
living self when it sheds the muddy vesture of
clay.... Such a being, acting from the
unseen upon the sphere of what is to us the
seen, might, under certain conditions, be able
to work what we call miracles.” It was the
good fortune of Mr. Glendinning to get beside
us on one occasion a most exquisite face of a
lady, full of each charm and grace that make
up the womanly character. The term angelic
might be applied to it. Such a face the seraphic
painters have ofttimes drawn, a Raphael
might have painted it. From somewhere must
have come this form; and Spiritualism demonstrates
what Mr. Justice Groves, in <cite>The Correlation
of Physical Forces</cite>, gives as a probable
theory, “Myriads of organised beings may exist
imperceptible to our vision, even if we were
among them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>A legal gentleman of some literary culture,
who had become conscious of the reality and
beauty of the spiritual philosophy, wrote several
valuable articles, in which were given the
clearest proofs of spirit identity. He was
most anxious to get the picture of a dear
boy whom death had carried away some years
before, and whose absence, perhaps, made him
at first inquire as to whether Spiritualism had
any joy to give.</p>

<p>Under the signature of “Edina” this gentleman
gives one of the most satisfactory bits of
evidence it would be possible to get. He made
attempts to get this portrait in Glasgow, but
in vain; though the child’s sister, who was
clairvoyant, saw him quite distinctly, “Edina”
was not able to get his impress on the plate.
I give the following from “Edina,” which surely
places beyond a doubt that these spirit photographs
are what they claim to be:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Seven separate attempts were made to get a
spirit photograph of our lost one—twice in Glasgow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
and five times in Edinburgh—and on every occasion,
although our family medium informed us that our
son was in the room and standing before the camera,
besides being assisted or attended by others of our
relatives, now on the other side, nothing was got but
faces of persons unknown to us. ‘Try and try
again’ has, however, always been our motto in
matters appertaining to the spirit world, and, though
we were discouraged, we resolved to persevere. Two
of the seven sittings were taken with Mr. David
Duguid, in Glasgow, and he also came to Edinburgh
and had two sittings, or trials, for photography in
our house, and in the room in which our son was
born and died, so that every favourable condition
possible was complied with, but all in vain. Mr.
Duguid was here early in April, 1892, giving his
second painting séance, and he again kindly offered
to make another effort to get what we desired. On
this occasion, I am proud to report that our efforts
have been crowned with conspicuous success. On
the night previous to the day on which our eighth
and successful sitting took place, a letter was automatically
written by our daughter, in the handwriting
we know so well, that of my wife’s eldest
sister, who passed over twenty-eight years ago, and
who has had charge of our son since he entered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
spirit world. The letter gave us full directions as to
next day’s experiment, and again requested it to be
made in the bedroom referred to. Mr. Duguid was
in Edinburgh the same night on which the letter
came, but he merely called, left his camera, and
arranged as to next day’s sitting. He returned next
day at noon, and the photographic sitting was at
once begun. The day was bright and clear, and the
conditions seemed to favour a good sitting. The
bedroom is a large one, being twenty feet long by
about fifteen feet broad, and is well lighted by a
plate-glass window, so that the light was excellent.</p>

<p>“Before dealing with the sitting, I premise that
the dry plates which were to be used in the camera
were purchased by us in a shop in Edinburgh on
the day preceding Mr. Duguid’s arrival, and the
chemicals required for the development of the negative
were what remained of the supply purchased
by us on the occasion of Mr. Duguid’s former visit.
The sitting began about twelve o’clock, and four
plates were first used by the medium. After an
hour two more plates were tried, and then we ceased
operations. These six plates were taken out one
by one from the paper in which they were wrapped,
by my second eldest daughter, in a ‘dark’ room,
lighted with a small red lamp, and then handed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
her to Mr. Duguid. He, in her presence, put each
plate, as it was required to be used, into the dark
slide, which he then took to the bedroom and inserted
in the camera. By desire of the medium my
wife and two daughters in succession, just before
each photograph was taken, put one of their hands
on the top of the camera for a second or two. As I
have said, six of the twelve plates purchased by us
were used at the sitting, and on development it was
found that on four of them there was a child’s face
and form appearing close to the sitters, who were my
wife and two daughters before referred to. After
the sitting closed, Mr. Duguid proposed to take the
four plates with him to Glasgow to get them printed
off; but pending his going home, he left the whole
series with us overnight, and got them from us next
day.</p>

<p>“In the interim, however, our anxiety as to the
child’s face on the four negatives led us to attempt
to print off an impression on some prepared paper
we had left in the house from the last futile experiment.
Accordingly, my second eldest daughter, who
has had some experience in amateur photography,
took the four plates I have above referred to, and
put them to be printed at one of the windows. On
examining the four impressions as they were printed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
off, we were gratified to find, on each of the four photographs
or copies so printed, a clear and well-defined
likeness of our departed son, not with a ‘shadowy’
or ‘filmy’ face, like some spirit photographs I have
seen, but quite ‘human-looking,’ although a sweeter
and more spiritual expression pervades the countenance
than when in earth life. The portrait of our
boy is as clear and distinct as the one we possess
of Professor Sandringham, which is admitted, by
every one who has seen it, to be a splendidly distinct
spirit photograph. The first of the negatives which
was printed off disclosed our boy sitting up in bed,
just in the place where he died, and although, as I
have said, his face is more spiritualised, and not so
chubby as when in earth life three years ago, yet
there is not the least doubt in our minds that it is
our loved and lost one as he is now on the other side.
The second photograph discloses him as clothed in
a boy’s suit, and sitting on his mother’s knee. Here
also the face is quite human-looking, and just our son
as he looked about the close of his sharp and severe
illness. The likeness in all the photographs is essentially
the same. Over the figure in each photograph
is a beautiful star, and the whole experiment has been
a phenomenal success in spirit photography, besides
being a source of great joy to us all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mr. Duguid was never in my house in Edinburgh
till the end of January last (1892). Two of
our family went twice to Glasgow—once in 1890 and
once in 1891—and had a sitting with him on the
occasion of each visit. Faces came on the negatives
on both occasions, but not the face wanted. At
these sittings nothing was said to Mr. Duguid as
to our family affairs, or the appearance of our boy,
but he was told what we wanted, and did his best to
get a satisfactory result. We were not disappointed
at failure, because we knew, the difficulties attending
the experiment. The only photograph we have of
our son was got when he was two years old, and is
not at all like what he was when he was taken from
us. The photograph was shown by me to Mr.
Duguid for the first and only time on the day
succeeding the successful sitting, and after the negatives
had been printed off in the manner before
detailed. The dry plates were our own, and were
never handled by the medium till he put them in
the slide or box as before described. The chemicals
were ours, and the development took place in
the presence of my second eldest daughter, in the
dark room before referred to, and to which we all
had access during the whole process. I therefore
claim that this demonstration has been a complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
success, because every test condition has been complied
with. As ‘Salem Scudder’ puts it, in a certain
sensational scene in Dion Boucicault’s well-known
drama of the <cite>Octoroon</cite>, ‘I guess the apparatus can’t
lie.’ The apparatus, <i>i.e.</i>, the camera, has certainly
not lied to us. I have also to state that our family
medium saw our son in the room ‘posed’ in front
of the camera during the sitting and pointed out
the place where he stood, before the medium put
the slide into the instrument.</p>

<p>“It has been with considerable reluctance that
I have alluded to so much that is sacred and
personal in our family, but in the interests of spiritual
truth, and for the sole purpose of showing that spirit
photography, by an honest medium like Mr. David
Duguid, is possible, I have deemed it necessary to
give these facts, and they have been stated with all
the care and minuteness of detail in my power. As
I have said, we failed seven times; but the eighth
trial gave us something to treasure for life. We
are certainly under a deep debt of gratitude to Mr.
David Duguid for the beneficent use of his mediumistic
powers in literally ‘giving us back our dead,’ or
rather, showing us our dear one clothed as he now
is, in his spiritual body, as on the other side.</p>

<p>“These are the consolations of Spiritualism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
which the uninstructed cannot understand or appreciate.
In my humble judgment Spiritualistic
research should be prosecuted in the <em>home</em>, as, there
only, results will be got of the best and purest kind.
That at least has been our experience, and we
gratefully acknowledge the mercies bestowed on us.”</p>

</div>

<p>Why should we not accept this as a truthful
statement? The word of such a man as
“Edina” would be accepted to the full on
any other subject, but there is a deep-rooted
antipathy in the public mind against the recognition
or acceptance of spiritual phenomena.
Florence Marryat, in describing the striking
and marvellous incidents of her life, asks why
she should be disbelieved in these matters any
more than Lady Brassey, or Livingstone, or
Stanley regarding their travels.</p>

<p>The most conclusive of testimony as to the
reality of spirit photography was that recently
given in London by Mr. Traill Taylor, editor
of the <cite>British Journal of Photography</cite>, and one
of the most capable men it was possible to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
get for entering into an investigation of this
matter. Mr. Taylor holds the first of scientific
reputations, and would have been selected by all
the leading minds in the world of photography
as worthy of representing it. The story told
by him is clear in every detail as to the methods
he adopted to meet any objections that might
arise, and the success attained was quite in
keeping with what had hitherto been got by
Mr. Glendinning and others in their Glasgow
experiments. Mr. Glendinning felt so confident
that other honest minds could only reach the
same results as himself, that he prevailed on
Mr. Duguid to visit London, and give these test
sittings to Mr. Taylor. This is another stone
in the fabric of evidence that builds up the
new spiritual truths. Such evidence has been
given again and again by other workers in
this field, but scarcely ever before by a person
enjoying such a reputation in this special
domain as does Mr. Taylor.</p>

<p>It was scarcely to be expected that Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Taylor’s statement, clear as it is, and which, had
it had no connexion with spiritual phenomena,
would have been welcomed and widely applauded,
would be accepted. Even as Wm.
Crookes, F.R.S., when he blessed Spiritualism,
instead of cursing it as was expected, met with
a tremendous amount of ridicule and malignity,
so has Mr. Taylor. Those who heard the story,
while admitting that Mr. Taylor was quite the
ablest man in the ranks to enter on such an
investigation, still felt that <em>they</em> would have been
abler still, and yet no one could point out any
other precautions which might have been taken.
As one who was present I know the matter was
entirely in his (Mr. Taylor’s) hands to do as
seemed to him best. We were as desirous of
truth as he was, and the unprejudiced mind
could only find in it all, results which are
perfectly conclusive of the reality of spirit photography.
Mr. Stead gives publicity to one of
the pictures obtained by Mr. Taylor, in the
April number of <cite>Review of Reviews</cite>, and concludes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
his remarks by saying that “Everything,
of course, depends upon the accuracy and
honesty of the photographer, and the reputation
of Mr. Taylor and Mr. Glendinning is above
reproach,” and so is it also with the medium
(Mr. Duguid) who only contributed his presence
during the experiments, taking the least interest
really of all those who were present.</p>

<p>It might be asked what kind of evidence
would be accepted to prove the reality of the
various phases of spiritual phenomena? Could
a Tyndall or a Huxley have done more in an
investigation of this kind than was done by Mr.
Taylor, Mr. Glendinning, and those who were
associated with them? Were photography the
sole phenomenon associated with the movement,
this might require to be investigated again and
again, but for over thirty years certain positive
statements have been made, and the evidence
tendered, as to the reality of spirit raps, which
psychical science can throw no light upon.</p>

<p>Cromwell Varley, F.R.S., with his acknowledged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
electrical experience, thought he could
soon explode the spirit theory, but, instead,
he became a devoted and courageous
spiritualist. William Crookes, F.R.S., and Dr.
Alfred Russel Wallace, F.R.S., have alike
testified to the spirit raps, and to the
phase of materialisation by which forms solid
and tangible are built up. Mr. Crookes on
many occasions has photographed these physicalised
“forms,” and Dr. Wallace has vouched
for the fact that with a spirit medium
he got a photograph, and, on sending this
abroad to other relatives, it was at once
recognised as the portrait of his departed
mother, and certain peculiarities which could
not be imitated made the matter more certain.</p>

<p>Mr. Taylor has done nothing new, only
corroborated what the many bold but practical
people had found out before—the people who,
to get at truth, had stood any number of hard
names. They were not deceivers or idlers
carried away by the light of an idea, but practical,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
sober-minded people, who trusted to nothing
but experiment, and willing to tread down
any amount of obstacles that truth might be
reached. A man like Mr. Andrew Glendinning,
certain of the facts of spirit communion, might,
had he been selfishly inclined, have allowed the
world to sneer on, and have troubled little about
the accumulation of evidence; but the rich fruits
he had gathered during many years made a
naturally generous nature anxious to share
them with others. The propagation of an unpopular
idea was not likely to bring him honour
of any kind. He knew well what all past
experimenters had to face, but he was determined
this question should be placed in such
a position that there would be no reason for
cavil. It has been with much patience, and
amid many suspicions, that this careful investigator
has helped to make palpable that
there is a roadway between the “undiscovered
country” of spirit life and this world of ours;
that the transcendent intuitions of poets and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
seers have been founded on realities which are
now being demonstrated.</p>

<p>We spiritualists have indeed got to know,
beyond a doubt, what the human race had not
learned in its thousands of years, viz., that death
is a delusion. The lamp has been kindled at
the light gleaming from the sky, and nothing
can again put out the flame.</p>

<p>Spiritualism has a certain aim, and does not
mean to drift. It has come for a divine purpose,
to be sacredly cherished and unfolded.
Even Mr. Stead, the longer he pursues his investigations,
has less and less to say regarding
the danger of investigation. He feels and
acknowledges that he has entered upon a realm
which may yet have many priceless gems to
give up. The spiritualist must be a <em>come-outer</em>,
able to break away from trammels and all
despotic traditions. The fear of the Evil One,
the bad odour associated with the name “witchcraft,”
the unwise and weak bits in Old Testament
history, stop him not in his investigations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
“Thou shalt” and “thou shalt not” of tradition
he asks the authority for, taking nothing on
authority but truths which can be demonstrated.</p>

<p>If the world applauds those who joined
together fire and water and iron and made it
ready to do men’s bidding, if it reverences those
who with audacious hands have taken the
lightning from heaven and sent it to carry
tidings between the ends of the earth, so will
it one day surely reverence and honour the
many spiritual workers who have toiled bravely
to make it evident that there is no death. “He
that walks with humble men,” says a wise
teacher, “often stumbles over masses of unsunned
gold where men, proud in emptiness,
looked only for common dust.”</p>

<p>Why should intelligent men mock at small
beginnings like the rise of the modern spiritual
movement? The great institutions which have
done the best work for mankind have had to
face the same kind of sneer and ridicule. History
repeats itself all the time. As Lecky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
eloquently points out, the Christian religion,
which was surely a potent force for good or
evil, was unseen by the leading minds who
made up the intellectual force of the Roman
empire. No single man of weight saw in it
a conquering power, but glanced at it as something
weak and ignoble. Carlyle regrets that
the wise and penetrating Tacitus could only
see in it a weak superstition, while he (Carlyle)
held somewhat similar views about Spiritualism
(which, according to Theodore Parker, has more
evidence for its wonders than any other historic
form of religion), as the best word he could
offer was that it was “the religion of Dead Sea
apes.”</p>

<p>That the idea of spirit communion will
grow and find a place in the people’s hearts
is as certain as that the sun shines each day.
The best of minds have welcomed it, even
those who could not tolerate it at first. It is
indeed a choice revelation of higher import
than all physical science has yet given. Elizabeth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Barrett Browning wondered how the
world, weeping for its dead, did not accord
it warm welcome. She found in Spiritualism
the richest consolation. This age has almost
witnessed the abolition of slavery, and to-day
there is not more antagonism to Spiritualism
than sixty years since there was towards the
anti-slavery party. Lloyd Garrison, afterwards
a pronounced Spiritualist, was indeed bold for
conscience sake, for truth and justice, when he
started the <cite>Liberator</cite>. It did not seem as if
the idea which possessed him could take root.
When his enemies made inquiry as to Garrison’s
movements in 1831, they reported that his
office was in an obscure hole, his only visible
auxiliary a negro-boy, and his supporters a
few insignificant persons of all colours—and
yet in spite of this early report his idea shook
the world. The man and the negro-boy were
pretty vigorous, and there was a great truth
promulgated from that obscure hole.</p>

<p>Spiritualism, through the brave advocacy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
of heroic men and women, is at last becoming
credible; more toleration is now shown for its
claims. Phenomena once considered trivial
now receive attention. Many are awakening
to the new thought, and becoming better able
to read the mystery of their past lives through
what it teaches. The influence of a noted
journalist like Mr. Stead is sure to keep the
flame alight, and divert the thought of those
who want rest on this most important of all
problems that concern us. Thanks to such
men as Wallace, Crookes, Stainton Moses,
Taylor, and others, who have collected and
verified facts so patiently, and demonstrated
so surely that our dead live on, and take an
affectionate interest in our goings out and
comings in.</p>

</div>

<p>Either the discoveries made by Mumler,
Stainton Moses, Beattie and others, have
now been confirmed, or a very eminent man,
specially trained in rigid investigation, and an
acknowledged expert in optics and the chemistry
and manipulation of photography, has
been the victim of a marvellous and inexplicable
delusion.</p>

<p>To say that, notwithstanding all the precautions
arranged, and carefully carried out
by Mr. Taylor, he was time after time
deceived, is to make a statement entirely
opposed to probability and common sense,
yet that is the false refuge to which some fly
from whom better things might be expected.
It exhibits strongly the credulity of incredulity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
and an ability to strain out a gnat but swallow
a camel. To print insinuations against the
characters of those who investigate new and
important facts, and to air the superior wisdom
of the critics in what are apparently intended
as witticisms, may serve the purpose of a day,
but truth remains unsoiled and unassailable.</p>

<p>When George Cruikshank was preparing
his pictorial <i lang="fr">brochure</i> against Spiritualism, he
was asked what he knew of the subject; he
replied he knew nothing, and did not intend
to inform himself till he had finished his book.
That is the position of many in regard to spirit
photography; the less they know about it, the
more they feel qualified to judge; and a man
who, for the first time, deigns to consider it,
will, with the utmost confidence in his own
opinion, condemn as fraudulent a genuine spirit
photograph; yea, he will even profess to discover
the mark of the scissors and the grain
of the paper from which he imagines the
photograph has been cut and copied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>Other objectors profess to have looked into
the subject, but because <em>they</em> saw nothing they
thought worth following up, therefore they
practically conclude it is impossible any one
else can be more fortunate.</p>

<p>That there are, and will continue to be,
honest doubters goes without saying. There
are scientific men who cannot believe in the
possibility of this new thing—their minds are
in old grooves. Others say the consensus of
opinion of photographers is against it.
Granted; and what of that? Any mere
opinion as to whether spirit photography be
possible does not in any way affect the question.
Opinions do not alter facts. The facts
in this matter are entirely in favour of the
reality of spirit photography.</p>

<p>There need not now be any question as
to whether spirit photography is possible.
That was settled thirty years ago. There is
nothing in the whole range of psychic phenomena
for which the evidence is more conclusive.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Had there been no other proof, the sworn evidence
of scientific men, bankers, merchants,
lawyers, photographers, and others, at the
Mumler trial was overwhelmingly abundant.
And since that trial there has been an accumulation
of evidence from various quarters,
yielding proof upon proof that spirit photography
is a fact, and must be recognised as
such. Contradicted it can be; that is easy to
do. Sneered at it may be; that, too, is not
difficult. A man may sneer at a fact which
he is unable to comprehend, but a sneer proves
nothing. Neither does an unsupported contradiction,
whether the contradiction be made
by a single person, or be made as a formal
resolution by a society.</p>

<p>Some of the witnesses who were examined
on oath at Mumler’s trial were experts, such
as Samuel K. Fanshaw. That gentleman was
one of the best miniature painters and facial
experts in New York, and was also familiar
with photographic manipulations. He said he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
went to Mumler an entire stranger, sat for a
picture, witnessed the whole process, and received
a likeness of his mother, which he said
was more like her than the one he had painted
from memory. Mr. Livermore, banker, had
three negatives, in which his wife appeared
in three different positions. He was accompanied
by Mr. Hitchcock, of the <cite>New York
Sun</cite>, and Mr. Gurney, a leading photographer.
When Judge Dowling asked Mr. Livermore if
he recognised these pictures as likenesses of
his wife, his answer was, “<em>Unmistakably</em>.”</p>

<p>The spirit photograph of Abraham Lincoln
has often been referred to. My copy of it
is now too faint for reproduction, but it may
be stated that when Mrs. Lincoln visited Mr.
Mumler, she wore a thick crape veil, so thick
that no one could distinguish a feature of her
face. She travelled under an assumed name
from Springfield (Illinois) to Boston, went
direct from the train to Mumler’s house, gave
her name as “Mrs. Lindall,” and did not remove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
her veil till the prepared plate was in
the camera ready to be exposed. She obtained
an excellent picture of her husband, standing
behind her, with his hands resting on her
shoulders, and looking down with a pleasant
smile.</p>

<p>Prominent Americans, whose names are well
known in this country, received through Mumler’s
mediumship test spirit photographs of
friends whom they recognised. Amongst these
may be mentioned the Hon. Henry Wilson,
then Vice-President of the United States, Judge
Edmonds, and William Lloyd Garrison.</p>

<p>As a fair specimen of spirit photographs
obtained through Mumler, I submit one (see
opposite) got by the Hon. Moses A. Dow, who
was editor and proprietor of the <cite>Waverley Magazine</cite>,
Boston. The portrait was fully recognised
by Mr. Dow as that of an amiable and accomplished
young lady who had been his assistant
editor. Before sitting for the portrait Mr. Dow
had a séance with a lady medium, and received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
from her a message, which purported to be from
his late assistant editor, instructing him when to
go to Mumler’s for the picture, stating that she
would appear with a wreath of lilies on her
head, would stand by his side, would put her
hand on his shoulder, and would bring him
beautiful flowers. The photograph has lost
some of its intensity; but in the original
negative the wreath of white lilies is very
distinct, and the spirit is holding between the
thumb and forefinger of the left hand an opening
moss-rosebud, the exact counterpart of one
which Mr. Dow placed between the thumb and
forefinger of her left hand, while her body lay
in the coffin just before the funeral.</p>

<p>Similar tests have been obtained in photographs
by other mediums. On one occasion
Mr. Parkes had a visit from a friend who
had promised to spend a forenoon and try
experiments, but he was unwilling to sit
for a portrait owing to sudden and severe
illness, which he said would prevent any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
success. He was induced by his wife to try.
While Mr. Parkes was preparing a plate with
collodion his friend sat down to compose
himself, and at once he became conscious of
the presence of a spirit form by the kindly
way passes were made over his head, curing
him entirely of his painful illness. On the
plate being developed there was a graceful
female form standing beside him, with her
head bent downwards towards him, and behind
her—extending outwards and upwards from
her shoulders—there was a patch of light
seemingly intended to represent wings. The
sitter afterwards solved the enigma by stating
that the influence from the spirit was of such
a sweet and delightful character, that it led
him to hum to himself his favourite hymn:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“How delightful the thought that the Angels in bliss,</div>
<div class="verse">Daily bend <em>their bright wings</em> to a world such as this,</div>
<div class="verse">And leave the sweet songs of the mansions above,</div>
<div class="verse">To breathe on our bosoms some message of love.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>The imagery of the hymn found an embodiment
in the photograph. “I have no
wings—nor do I require wings,” subsequently
explained the spirit, “but the appearance of
wings was assumed to please father.” Her
father was the sitter. Little thought he when
waiting with a sad heart at the dying bed of
a loved daughter, and trying to sing the
children’s hymn, that the time would arrive
when she would come from her spirit home to
cheer him in hours of sorrow and give him her
portrait, or that she would be able to render
herself visible to normal sight, and with her
arms round father and mother, kiss them both
and speak to them both. Such are some of
the secret blessings which come to those who
wait, work, and pray.</p>

<p>The difficulties and discouragements which
arise in trying to photograph unseen forms do
not exist to the same extent in photographing
what are called “materialised forms.” Some
excellent results in the latter have been obtained
by various persons. The most notable
instances are those by Mr. Wm. Crookes,
F.R.S., recorded in the last chapter of his
valuable book, <cite>Phenomena of Spiritualism</cite>, on
the photographing of the spirit, Katie King, by
the electric light. At these experiments Mr.
Crookes had five complete sets of photographic
apparatus fitted up, all of which were used at
the same time at each séance, and some excellent
negatives were obtained. “But,” adds Mr.
Crookes, “photography is as inadequate to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
depict the perfect beauty of Katie’s face as
words are powerless to describe her charms of
manner. Photography may, indeed, give a map
of her countenance; but how can it reproduce
the brilliant purity of her complexion, or the
ever-varying expression of her most mobile
features, now overshadowed with sadness when
relating some of the bitter experiences of her
past life, now smiling with all the innocence of
happy girlhood when she had collected my
children round her, and was amusing them by
recounting anecdotes of her adventures in
India?</p>

<p>Amongst the important papers contributed
to the Psychical Congress at Chicago, one was
sent, at the request of the Committee, by
Dr. Alfred Russel Wallace, F.R.S. In it he
says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“What are termed spirit photographs, the appearance
on a photographic plate of other figures besides
those of the sitters, often those of deceased friends of
the sitters, have now been known for more than
twenty years. Many competent observers have tried
experiments successfully; but the facts seemed too
extraordinary to carry conviction to any but the
experimenters themselves, and any allusion to the
subject has usually been met with a smile of
incredulity or a confident assertion of imposture. It
mattered not that most of the witnesses were
experienced photographers who took precautions
which rendered it absolutely impossible that they
were imposed upon. The most incredible suppositions
were put forth, by those who only had
ignorance and incredulity to qualify them as judges,
in order to show that deception was possible. And
now we have another competent witness, Mr. Traill
Taylor, for many years editor of the <cite>British Journal
of Photography</cite>, who, taking every precaution that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
life-long experience could suggest, yet obtained on his
plates figures which, so far as normal photography is
concerned, ought not to have been there.”</p>

</div>

<p>Dr. Wallace has given a great deal of
thoughtful consideration to this subject, and
has a large collection of genuine spirit photographs.
In his book, <cite>Miracles and Modern
Spiritualism</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> he devotes sixteen pages specially
to the topic. These pages—like everything
else from Dr. Wallace’s pen—are worthy of
careful study, the following sentences particularly
so:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It may be as well to clear away a popular
misconception. Mr. G. H. Lewes advised the
Dialectical Committee to distinguish carefully between
‘facts and inferences from facts.’ This is
especially necessary in the case of what are called
spirit photographs. The figures which occur in
these, when not produced by any human agency,
may be of ‘spiritual’ origin, without being figures
‘of spirits.’ There is much evidence to show that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
they are, in some cases, forms produced by invisible
intelligences, but distinct from them. In other cases
the intelligence appears to clothe itself with matter
capable of being perceived by us; but even then it
does not follow that the form produced is the actual
image of the spiritual form. It may be but a reproduction
of the former mortal form with its terrestrial
accompaniments, <em>for purposes of recognition</em>. Most
persons have heard of these ‘ghost pictures,’ and
how easily they can be made to order by any photographer,
and are therefore disposed to think they
can be of no use as evidence. But a little consideration
will show that the means by which sham
ghosts can be manufactured being so well known
to all photographers, it becomes easy to apply tests
or arrange conditions so as to prevent imposition.</p>

<p>“The following are some of the more obvious:—1.
If a person with a knowledge of photography
takes his own glass plates, examines the camera
used and all the accessories, and watches the whole
process of taking a picture, then, if any definite form
appears on the negative besides the sitter, it is a
proof that some object was present capable of reflecting
or emitting the actinic rays, although invisible
to those present. 2. If an unmistakable likeness
appears of a deceased person totally unknown to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
the photographer. 3. If figures appear on the
negative having a definite relation to the figure of
the sitter, who chooses his own position, attitude,
and accompaniments, it is a proof that invisible
figures were really there. 4. If a figure appears
draped in white, and partly behind the dark body
of the sitter without in the least showing through,
it is a proof that the white figure was there at the
same time, because the dark parts of the negative
are transparent, and any white picture in any way
superposed would show through. 5. Even should
none of these tests be applied, yet if a medium,
quite independent of the photographer, sees and
describes a figure during the sitting, and an exactly
corresponding figure appears on the plate, it is a
proof that such a figure was there.</p>

<p>“Every one of these tests have now been successfully
applied in our own country.”</p>

</div>

<p>Dr. Wallace gives minute details of some
experiments which resulted in his obtaining
photographs which he recognised as <em>unmistakable
likenesses</em> of his mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When Mr. Duguid was first asked to come
to London to give test séances to Mr. Taylor,
it was hoped that Mr. Stainton Moses would
have so far recovered strength as to be present
at the experiments. He took great interest in
the subject, and many of his photographs have
been reproduced by Mr. Arthur Maltby and
Mr. Acton. On March 19th and 26th Mr.
Maltby gave lectures in the Athenæum Hall,
and exhibited on the lantern screen a number
of spirit-photograph transparencies. Here are
a few notes made at the meeting on March 19th,
by Mr. Burns, jun. Mr. Maltby said:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This lecture is given in memory of the late
Mr. Stainton Moses, better known as ‘M.A., Oxon,’
editor of <cite>Light</cite>, writer of many valuable books on
Spiritualism, and one of the best friends the cause
ever had. Most of you have either read or heard of
his marvellous book called <cite>Spirit Teachings</cite>, one of
the grandest series of spirit controls ever published.
It teaches a higher Spiritualism than is generally
understood.</p>

<p>“My object in giving this lecture is to try to convince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
you that it is possible to obtain photographs of
friends who have passed away. I shall also endeavour
to explain the conditions necessary, how they are
attained, and for what reason. This lecture was
suggested by Mr. Stainton Moses, and the pictures I
am about to show you were his. I knew him for
over fifteen years, and have been favoured with
particulars of the most remarkable events ever
experienced.</p>

<p>“One morning last spring I called on Mr. Moses,
and found him busy reading proof-sheets of Mr.
Stead’s <cite>Real Ghost Stories</cite>. Whilst discussing these,
the subject of spirit photographs was introduced,
and he informed me that he had a collection of
nearly 400, which he offered to lend me if I thought
they could be suitably converted into lantern slides.
After examining the photographs, I found it impossible
in so short a time to select out of so many
sufficient for a lecture. I therefore begged the loan
of them all, and we are indebted to my friend and
co-worker, Mr. Acton (who is now manipulating the
lantern), for his patient efforts in converting so many
photographs into lantern transparencies. It was a
most laborious task.</p>

<p>“Three months later, when I returned the photographs,
Mr. Moses kindly offered to take the chair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
at this lecture, but that was not to be. The day I
was to submit my notes for his approval, with the
promise of a further and more complete description
of the spirit photographs, he had passed to the higher
life.</p>

<p>“Many present to-night, who are aware of the
reality of life after death—a life ever progressive, and
as real as life on earth—can feel with me that this
noble worker is not dead, but lives, continuing his
efforts for the good of humanity as when on earth;
ever with us in our efforts to spread this glorious
truth, which is like the sunshine, dispersing the fog
and mist of orthodoxy and ignorance.</p>

<p>“All the sittings he attended were under strict
test conditions, so there could be no possibility of
fraud or deception. These conditions were, that he
purchased his own plates, marked each with his initials,
put them in and took them out of the dark slide,
not allowing them out of his sight until they were
fully developed.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Maltby then showed on the lantern
screen about forty spirit photographs, and other
pictures connected with the subject, all of which
he explained. Many of the photographs of
spirits had been recognised by the sitters and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
other relatives. He then spoke of the spiritual
advantages to be derived from spirit communion,
and after an invocation he thus concluded:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Should this lecture induce any present to seek
communion with their departed friends, let me beg
of them to seek only for spiritual aid in an earnest
and prayerful manner, in their own homes, amongst
friends who desire to know the truth and will investigate
with unbiassed minds. To such success must
come, sooner or later; but those who try to use God’s
spiritual gifts for worldly and selfish ends will bring
disaster on themselves and discredit on the cause.”</p>

</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At a séance held twenty-nine years ago, the
following question was put as to spirit photographs:
“We do not comprehend how these are
produced. Can you give us any information as
to the process gone through?” The answer
given through the medium, Mr. Peter A.
Chesser, marine engineer, may be of interest to
some. It was this: “Spirits impress their
image on the plate by depositing thereon repeated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
layers of magnetism. According to
their respective powers of affording this, so is
the impression more or less distinct. The
magnetism must be of the same texture or
affinity as that possessed by the operator; it is
accomplished by a rapid vibration of the spirits’
magnetic emanation in depositing layer after
layer, and the process is this: The operator by
frequent manipulation saturates his materials
with his aura—I do not mean the animal aura
of mesmerism, but his spiritual aura; this, by
repeated impression on his part from repeated
manipulations (which require considerable time,
since he is still in the body and has, therefore,
more difficulty in, as it were, filtering this spirit-aura
through the pores of his body than have
the spirits, who are not trammelled in like
manner), at last leaves a positive viscidity on his
materials which serves to retain the first impressions
thrown by the spirits upon it. When
they from affinity cohere, the image is rapidly
built up on this superstructure. Any person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
through the pores of whose body-material this
spirit-aura can readily pass is in a condition to
take photographs of the kind to which you
refer. Much passiveness, however, is requisite.”</p>

<p>This reply refers, of course, to the photographs
in class No. I., mentioned in the Preface,
not to pictures which are produced by spirit
precipitation.</p>

<p>In experiments made with Mr. Chesser at
that time (1864), we used the wet-collodion process,
on new glass plates which were cut for us
by a glass merchant. The plates were carefully
cleansed and finally washed and rubbed by myself
with spirits of wine. We never used a plate
twice in such experiments. What is worth
doing at all is worth doing well and carefully.
We obtained some pictures which would have
been of interest had we possessed more knowledge
of the subject, but we aimed too high and
were not satisfied with slow progress. In fact we
wanted a clear and good likeness of one of our
relatives, so several plates were broken and put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
in the dust-bin which, in the light thrown on the
subject by later experience, we should have
prized. One plate of that period was kept because
it had a shadowy image of the medium,
although he was not within the field of view
when the plate was exposed. Unfortunately,
the photograph was not intensified; for when I
was washing it at the tap, the water got between
the plate and the collodion, and away went the
film, but, although torn, I managed to spread
part of it on the glass again. The following
statement was made by one of our unseen
friends with respect to that picture. Our questions
were put through the medium, and the
answers were given by automatic writing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Question</span>: We have here a photograph
upon which there exists so much diversity of
opinion that we want to know what it is?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Answer</span>: It is yourself, distinctly enough,
but as we see your next question we will proceed
to explain how it came about that such impression
was produced on the plate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Medium</span>: Stop a moment—do you
mean that it is my body or my spirit?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Answer</span>: We mean your spirit-aura. Your
body could not be taken without your being
either directly in front of the camera or reflected
into its focus. Perhaps it will be better to explain
some of the peculiarities attending this
phase, as it involves many points of interest.
You were standing in front of the camera for
about a quarter of an hour before the picture
was taken or the plate prepared. In obedience
to a suggestion, you were awaiting the approach
of the spirit who told you he could be photographed,
and, in order to retain your passivity,
you remained standing where you were. When
you saw him seated you went to prepare the
plate, but not without leaving your emanation
behind, which, on the plate being exposed, was
duly photographed. The proof is easy. Again
stand in the same position for, say, ten minutes,
then leave the room, and let a good clairvoyant
be introduced and questioned as to what he sees,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
when he will immediately describe you as supplying
the place you have vacated, with all the
accessories pertaining thereto. But although he
could at all times see this, your emanation could
not at all times be impressed on the plate. Returning
to another matter: Man does not enjoy
only one image of himself, but six, embracing
three individualities, viz., body, soul, and spirit;
and three emanations proceeding therefrom, respectively,
body-odyle, spirit-aura, and soul-essence.
These must on no account be confounded
with each other, as is too often the
case. Respecting the last—soul and soul-essence—as
it is more remote, being seldom
brought into play outside the human tenement
(unless under peculiar circumstances), we do
not intend speaking of it in connexion with the
present topic; so direct your attention more
particularly to the remaining four, partly in explanation
of their attributes, and partly in reference
to photography. First, then, the body is
most easily impressed upon the plate, requiring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
fewer vibrations than its odylic form, after which,
in order, come spirit, spirit-aura, soul and soul-essence,
the last requiring millions of vibrations,
which, although costing more effort, takes no
more time, in many cases. It depends on the
sphere of the spirit. You may form an idea of
this by taking into account the incredible power
of motion which spirits possess. Now, the odylic
emanation may be projected by the will from
the material body, but the spirit cannot itself be
so projected; it must be, as it were, allowed to
flow forth of its own accord. Similarly, the
spirit, when thus free to move, can project its
aura in like manner. In both these cases the
emanation, by its velocity, becomes from necessary
friction respectively electrified, or magnetic
and spiritualised; that is to say, the emanations
become endowed with a certain amount of vital
energy, life-force, or, in fact, of existence. The
mere life-force does not imply intelligence also,
but it does when the emanation is spiritualised.
Man’s <em>will</em> is from his spirit; hence, the will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
can project the odyle, but not the spirit, for
when the spirit is absent the will is absent, dormant
in reality (as the soul never interferes with
the will), and the trance state results. It is
quite possible for the spirit, under favourable
conditions, to project its aura at the same time
as the projection of the odyle. The two emanations
coming into contact would form a union of
the life-element with the thinking principle.
We do not mean with thought, but with thought-material—thought
being supplied only by the
spirit, the ideas or germs of thought being suggested
by the soul and elaborated by the spirit.
Without this constant emanation, or fluid impulse
(viz., the soul-essence) to urge it, the spirit
would not think; it would be inactive, the
soul-essence being its vivifying impulse to
activity. Now, when the odyle and aura have
coalesced, a new body, complete in all its
functions, is not therefore the result, but merely
a body-elementary, <i>i.e.</i>, imbued with life-force,
and furnished with thought-material, minus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
thought. This, then, is the eidolon, image, you
occasionally hear of. Still, you must not
suppose it to be severed from the parent body;
by no means: it is linked to it by attraction,
gravitation, and affinity, or that element of
which you can form ideas for practical purposes,
but of which you do not understand the nature.
But, you may say, there are instances of
eidolons speaking; now, if it has not thought,
how can it speak rationally? Let us explain:
thoughts are produced by vibrations of their
materials, and vibration is produced by the soul-essence
through the spirit, the soul being the
prime reservoir of motion (intellectually). Now,
suppose the eidolon to be questioned by the
person to whom it appeared, this question being
the result of thought, vibration would communicate
the motion to the intellectual materials
of the eidolon, and this vibration would be
instantly felt by the parent body, and an answer
returned accordingly.</p>

<p>In reference to the suggestion that spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
manifestations may be the work of eidolons,
the reply was: “As departed spirits do exist,
and can communicate with mortals—of which
there is abundant proof—there is no need to
suppose a state of things which does not exist
in order to account for what does.”</p>

<p>An explanation was also given as to how
eidolons are formed, but that does not concern
our present subject.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Some investigators seem to think that the
same spirit forms ought not to appear on plates
with different people, and that if they do so
the circumstance warrants suspicion, if it is not
even a proof of fraud. This is an entire
mistake, and a mistake which can only be
made by those who have not investigated the
matter in a practical manner for any considerable
length of time. Apply the same reasoning
to materialisation, or to direct spirit writing,
and see what it will lead to. Mr. E. A. D.
Opie, of Adelaide, in a lecture on “Spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
Photography,” delivered on July 1st, 1891,
before the Adelaide Spiritualistic Association,
made this remark: “It is necessary to accept
all second-hand reports of this phase of
Spiritualism with more than usual reserve,
as, in one instance at least, I have discovered,
on comparing reports of the obtaining of the
same picture by different people.” Mr. Opie
in these words probably expresses an opinion
held by many others, held in London as well
as in Adelaide. And what are we to infer
from it? That if two sitters get on their plates
a picture of the same spirit form, it will be a
proof of fraud? Not at all. Of course, if
the pictures have been produced by a dishonest
operator, they may be fraudulent. That is
not a thing to dispute. But the fact is that
there are in existence a number of genuine
spirit photographs in which the same abnormal
images are found with various sitters. Most
of these have differences in size, in attitude,
and in spirit drapery on the forms, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
likenesses are identical. Some of them have
been taken in different places, with different
cameras, with plates purchased in different
cities and used by careful investigators.</p>

<p>Mr. Opie’s lecture was published in Adelaide
as a pamphlet of twenty-two pages; it is the
result of much reading, and it is but fair to
Mr. Opie to note that he had no practical
acquaintance with the subject.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. Parkes gave some séances in 1875 in
Mr. Burns’s rooms, 15 Southampton Row. On
one occasion three sitters got spirit forms on
three plates. At the same meeting I requested
that I might be photographed. A clairvoyante
sitting near me said I ought to get something
good, for she could see a number of spirits near
me. When the plate was developed there were
eleven spirit forms on it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Several spirit photographs of children have
been obtained. One of these is the interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
one of “Edina’s” little boy, a full account of
which is in Mr. Robertson’s paper in this
volume. Another child’s portrait was got
<em>unexpectedly</em> at a test séance in April, 1892.
The arrangements and operations were under
my superintendence. I invited a lady (Mrs. J.
N. Anderson) to take a place near the sitter in
order to try whether her mediumistic power
would aid the experiment. I was vexed at not
getting the special result I wanted, but soon I
had cause for gladness in the joy which the
portrait obtained brought to the hearts of the
child’s father and mother. To the notes of the
séance, which were signed by all present, I
added the following words as a postscript:
“The child’s dress exhibits what was not
known to any person outside of Mr. Anderson’s
family.” That test is of a kind to impress a
mother’s mind. Previous to the child’s departure
he was lying cold in bed, when his
mother took from a drawer a night-dress of one
of her older boys, and put it on the ailing child.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
This night-dress had a certain kind of frill round
the neck-band; and that night-dress, with its
frill and long sleeves, is represented in the
photograph. There was no picture in existence
from which the photograph could have been
copied; and the likeness is not only attested
by the parents, but by friends of the family, and
by Mr. James Robertson, president of the
Glasgow Society, who had often seen the boy.</p>

<p>Some one may ask, how was the photograph
of the child obtained, seeing he was too
young to come unaided to stand before the
camera, or to impress his image on the prepared
plate without the camera? An interesting question,
no doubt. To it I reply, “I do not know:
I am stating facts, not trying to explain them.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the <cite>Review of Reviews</cite> for April, 1893,
Mr. Stead suggested that additional experiments
should be tried to obtain psychic pictures without
the agency of light or the camera. An
opportunity occurred in July to try the experiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
with a lady who is not known to Spiritualistic
or occult circles—albeit she is a good
medium and clairvoyant. A dry plate from
my packet of unused plates was placed in a
mahogany slide. The lady then held the slide
between the palms of her hands. She was
under continuous and close observation in a
well-lighted room, and one end of the slide was
held by myself. On putting the plate in the
developer, the picture of a child appeared on it.
The plate was not tampered with by any one,
nor was there any opportunity given to do so,
nor was it exposed to light until after it was
developed and fixed. A reproduction of the
picture is given herewith (<a href="#Page_145">see page 145</a>).</p>

<p>Mr. Stainton Moses, at a meeting of the
London Spiritualist Alliance, advised those who
intended to experiment in photography to employ
a stereoscopic camera. He considered that
the genuineness of spirit photographs so obtained
could not be called in question. This opinion
has also been held by other investigators. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
June, 1892, some spirit photographs were submitted
to an eminent scientific gentleman, together
with copies of the notes, detailing fully
the conditions under which the pictures were
obtained, and giving the names and addresses of
all those who were present at the experiments.
The opinion of the gentleman was expressed in
writing as follows, viz.:—“You have adopted
all the precautions I can think of as being
necessary. The only one thing else I can think
of is the employment of a binocular camera.
That is the <em>final Court of Appeal</em>, and a spirit
photograph taken by it can leave no room for
cavil.” To those who endorse this opinion I
may state I have eight photographs taken with
binocular cameras, all obtained under test conditions,
and all having abnormal figures which
are perfectly stereoscopic <i lang="la">per se</i>, as well as in
relation to the sitters. Halves of two of these
photographs accompany these miscellanea.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
They were obtained on the 21st October, 1893,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
on dry plates purchased from Mr. Doublet, and
the whole of the manipulations, so far as not
done by myself, were under my close and continuous
observation.</p>

<p>The results of Mr. Taylor’s investigations
are a prophecy and a lesson. A prophecy of
the coming time when photographs of our
friends, who have passed from earth-life, may
be obtainable by the co-operation with us of
spirits who desire to help us, and who will
find opportunities and conditions to enable
them to do so. When Mr. Stead’s proposal
for a spiritual bureau becomes an accomplished
fact, we may hope, and may reasonably expect,
that spirit photography will be a department
of it. Many strange events, which, fifty
years ago, seemed as unlikely, are now of
frequent occurrence. Mr. Taylor’s experiments
are a lesson, as well as a prophecy. A lesson
to the materialistic spirit of the age, to guide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
by new paths to old truths. The materialism
of to-day is dogmatic and active; it claims
science as its handmaid, it boasts that it has
sounded the universe and found in it nothing
but the material husks of existence, that all
spiritual beings are nonentities—the product
of diseased brains—of superstitious minds; its
scholars have explored space from star to
star and have learned that there is no God;
that man passes at death into cold oblivion, into
blank nothingness. To use the language of
its leading teachers:—“Unprejudiced philosophy
is <em>compelled</em> to reject the idea of an
individual immortality, and of a personal continuance
after death. With the decay and
dissolution of its material substratum, through
which alone it has acquired a conscious existence
and become a person, and upon which it
was dependent, <em>the spirit must cease to exist</em>!”</p>

<p>Again:—“Experience and daily observation
teach us <em>that the spirit perishes</em> with its material
substratum; that <em>man dies</em>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>And:—“There never has been, <em>and never
will be</em>, a real apparition, which could make
us believe or assume that the soul of a
deceased individual continues to exist: it is
dead, never to return.”</p>

<p>And once more:—“Spirits and ghosts are
only seen by diseased or superstitious individuals.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>Undoubtedly these views are quite honestly
arrived at and held by many. By some
through early training. By some in the
rebound from bigoted and God-dishonouring
creeds. By others again in painful perplexity
of mind, while trying to solve the problem of
existence. But a universe without a Deity,
and man without a soul, present little to boast
of in the shape of the consolation they can
bring to suffering humanity.</p>

<p>Every opinion a man holds must to some
extent influence his life, and the knowledge
that a man will live after death ought very
considerably to affect his entire character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>We know there is no such thing as death,
that what we call by that name is really a
birth into a higher sphere—or state of existence—an
entrance into a holier and happier
region, in whose precincts “we will be enabled
through untold ages to cultivate our intellects,
perfect our moral characters, and enjoy to
the full extent of our capabilities all that is
pure, good, true, and godly.</p>

<p>Some persons admit the reality of supermundane
photography, but say it is the work of
the Devil. How long is this old myth—this
theological superstition—to be flaunted in the
face of investigators? how long to be set as a
bugbear—a “bogey-man”—not merely to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
frighten naughty children, but to scare grown
men and women, to bar mental progress, and to
stereotype from age to age distorted views of
God, and of spiritual law and truth?</p>

<p>Some thoughts expressed by “Imperator” to
Mr. Stainton Moses, relating to this imaginary
prince of evil, are so excellent that no apology
is required for appending a few of them: “Cease
to be perplexed by thoughts of an imagined
Devil. For the honest, pure, and truthful soul
there is no Devil nor Prince of Evil such as
theology has feigned. Evil comes not nigh him,
the adversaries flee from his presence, and the
powers of evil are powerless before him. He is
guarded around by angel guards, ministered to
by bright spirits, who watch over him and direct
his footsteps. For him there waits a career of
progressive increase in knowledge, and in all
that elevates and ennobles the intelligence. He
need fear no Devil, unless he creates one for
himself. His affinity for good draws around
him influences for good. He is fenced around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
by guardians; nor can he, save by voluntary
surrender, fall a victim to the foe.”<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In narrating his experiments, Mr. Taylor
confined himself to a statement of facts; he
did not set forth the spiritualistic hypothesis,
nor did he say that any other would account
for the results. Some members of the Association
before whom he read his paper
were angry because Spiritualists claimed the
results as an argument in support of Spiritualism.
But why be angry? Any explanation
must cover the whole ground. And the explanation
offered by Spiritualists is the only one
which covers the whole ground. After all, the
facts are only one department of the wonders
of modern Spiritualism. What is the good
of the latter? is asked by those who have not
come within the range of its beneficent teachings.
The good of it? It has freed the mind from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
the bondage of dogma, it has swept away the
fear of death and the gloom of the grave, it has
purified the affections, it has brought much-needed
consolation in some of the hours of
earth’s bitterest sorrows, it has brought us into
communion with those we love and whom we
are wont to call dead—given us the knowledge
that they live, and given us a reason which
appeals to our personal experience that as they
live in a higher state of existence, we also shall
live after the change we call death.</p>

<p>Our grandest triumphs of science are but
trifles compared with what is before us to be
realised in the higher life. Yet men and
women of education and refinement can content
themselves with referring the most mysterious
spirit phenomena to conjuring and delusion,
and can descend to the inanity of trying to
shelve the whole matter by attacking the
characters of those whom they ought rather
to thank—to bless as the instruments through
whom the death-blow must be given to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
doctrine which denies the existence of the spirit
world, and of our after-life.</p>

<p>At the Photographic Congress held at the
World’s Fair, Judge Bradwell, of Chicago, was
chairman of the opening meeting. In his introductory
remarks, after summarising the
work done by photographers, he said: “I
have no doubt there are those within the
sound of my voice who will live to see the
time when photographic reproductions will be
sent from country to country as quickly as
are telegraphic messages to-day. In conclusion,
may I not ask, who shall say that the
camera, adjusted by the hand that feels, and
focussed by the sensitive eye that sees beyond,
with the aid of the intensely sensitive
dry plates, <em>shall not bring to light and view
the forms of our departed friends, and solve
the problem of immortality and life</em>?”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge Bradwell is answered. The
veil is lifted.</span></p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
